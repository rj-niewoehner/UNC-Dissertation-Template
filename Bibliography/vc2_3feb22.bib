abstract = {Objectives: To determine the degree of telemedicine expansion overall and across patient subpopulations and diagnoses. We hypothesized that telemedicine visits would increase substantially due to the need for continuity of care despite the disruptive effects of COVID-19. Study Design: A retrospective study of health insurance claims for telemedicine visits from January 1, 2018, through March 10, 2020 (prepandemic period), and March 11, 2020, through October 31, 2020 (pandemic period). Methods: We analyzed claims from 1,589,777 telemedicine visits that were submitted to Independence Blue Cross (Independence) from telemedicine-only providers and providers who traditionally deliver care in person. The primary exposure was the combination of individual behavior changes, state stay-at-home orders, and the Independence expansion of billing policies for telemedicine. The comparison population consisted of telemedicine visits in the prepandemic period. Results: Telemedicine increased rapidly from a mean (SD) of 773 (155) weekly visits in prepandemic 2020 to 45,632 (19,937) weekly visits in the pandemic period. During the pandemic period, a greater proportion of telemedicine users were older, had Medicare Advantage insurance plans, had existing chronic conditions, or resided in predominantly non-Hispanic Black or African American Census tracts compared with during the prepandemic period. A significant increase in telemedicine claims containing a mental health–related diagnosis was observed. Conclusions: Telemedicine expanded rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic across a broad range of clinical conditions and demographics. Although levels declined later in 2020, telemedicine utilization remained markedly higher than 2019 and 2018 levels. Trends suggest that telemedicine will likely play a key role in postpandemic care delivery.},

INFORMS provides unique networking and learning opportunities for individual professionals, and organizations of all types and sizes, to better understand and use O.R. and analytics tools and methods to transform strategic visions and achieve better outcomes.

Problem definition: This study addresses three important questions concerning the effectiveness of stay-at-home orders and sociodemographic disparities. (1) What is the average effect of the orders on the percentage of residents staying at home? (2) Is the effect heterogeneous across counties with different percentages of vulnerable populations (defined as those without health insurance or who did not attend high school)? (3) If so, why are the orders less effective for some counties than for others? Academic/practical relevance: To combat the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a number of states in the United States implemented stay-at-home orders that prevent residents from leaving their homes except for essential trips. These orders have drawn heavy criticism from the public because whether they are necessary and effective in increasing the number of residents staying at home is unclear. Methodology: We estimate the average effect of the orders using a difference-indifferences model, where the control group is the counties that did not implement the orders and the treatment group is the counties that did implement the orders during our study period. We estimate the heterogeneous effects of the orders by interacting county features with treatment dummies in a triple-difference model. Results: Using a unique set of mobile device data that track residents' mobility, we find that, although some residents already voluntarily stayed at home before the implementation of any order, the stay-at-home orders increased the number of residents staying at home by 2.832 percentage points (or 11.25%). We also find that these orders are less effective for counties with higher percentages of uninsured or less educated (i.e., did not attend high school) residents. To explore the mechanisms behind these results, we analyze the effect of the orders on the average number of work and nonwork trips per person. We find that the orders reduce the number of work trips by 0.053 (or 7.87%) and nonwork trips by 0.183 (or 6.50%). The percentage of uninsured or less educated residents in a county negatively correlates with the reduction in the number of work trips but does not correlate with the reduction in the number of nonwork trips. Managerial implications: Our results suggest that uninsured and less educated residents are less likely to follow the orders because their jobs prevent them from working from home. Policy makers must take into account the differences in residents' socioeconomic status when developing new policies or allocating limited healthcare resources.

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Parents hesitant to vaccinate their children may delay routine immunizations or seek exemptions from state vaccine mandates. Recent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States have drawn attention to this phenomenon. Improved understanding of the association between vaccine refusal and the epidemiology of these diseases is needed. OBJECTIVE To review the published literature to evaluate the association between vaccine delay, refusal, or exemption and the epidemiology of measles and pertussis, 2 vaccine-preventable diseases with recent US outbreaks. EVIDENCE REVIEW Search of PubMed through November 30, 2015, for reports of US measles outbreaks that have occurred since measles was declared eliminated in the United States (after January 1, 2000), endemic and epidemic pertussis since the lowest point in US pertussis incidence (after January 1, 1977), and for studies that assessed disease risk in the context of vaccine delay or exemption. FINDINGS We identified 18 published measles studies (9 annual summaries and 9 outbreak reports), which described 1416 measles cases (individual age range, 2 weeks-84 years; 178 cases younger than 12 months) and more than half (56.8%) had no history of measles vaccination. Of the 970 measles cases with detailed vaccination data, 574 cases were unvaccinated despite being vaccine eligible and 405 (70.6%) of these had nonmedical exemptions (eg, exemptions for religious or philosophical reasons, as opposed to medical contraindications; 41.8%of total). Among 32 reports of pertussis outbreaks, which included 10 609 individuals for whom vaccination status was reported (age range, 10 days-87 years), the 5 largest statewide epidemics had substantial proportions (range, 24%-45%) of unvaccinated or undervaccinated individuals. However, several pertussis outbreaks also occurred in highly vaccinated populations, indicating waning immunity. Nine reports (describing 12 outbreaks) provided detailed vaccination data on unimmunized cases; among 8 of these outbreaks from 59%through 93%of unvaccinated individuals were intentionally unvaccinated. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A substantial proportion of the US measles cases in the era after elimination were intentionally unvaccinated. The phenomenon of vaccine refusal was associated with an increased risk for measles among people who refuse vaccines and among fully vaccinated individuals. Although pertussis resurgence has been attributed to waning immunity and other factors, vaccine refusal was still associated with an increased risk for pertussis in some populations.},

abstract = {Vaccine hesitancy reflects concerns about the decision to vaccinate oneself or one's children. There is a broad range of factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy, including the compulsory nature of vaccines, their coincidental temporal relationships to adverse health outcomes, unfamiliarity with vaccine-preventable diseases, and lack of trust in corporations and public health agencies. Although vaccination is a norm in the U.S. and the majority of parents vaccinate their children, many do so amid concerns. The proportion of parents claiming non-medical exemptions to school immunization requirements has been increasing over the past decade. Vaccine refusal has been associated with outbreaks of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b disease, varicella, pneumococcal disease, measles, and pertussis, resulting in the unnecessary suffering of young children and waste of limited public health resources. Vaccine hesitancy is an extremely important issue that needs to be addressed because effective control of vaccine-preventable diseases generally requires indefinite maintenance of extremely high rates of timely vaccination. The multifactorial and complex causes of vaccine hesitancy require a broad range of approaches on the individual, provider, health system, and national levels. These include standardized measurement tools to quantify and locate clustering of vaccine hesitancy and better understand issues of trust; rapid, independent, and transparent review of an enhanced and appropriately funded vaccine safety system; adequate reimbursement for vaccine risk communication in doctors' offices; and individually tailored messages for parents who have vaccine concerns, especially first-time pregnant women. The potential of vaccines to prevent illness and save lives has never been greater. Yet, that potential is directly dependent on parental acceptance of vaccines, which requires confidence in vaccines, healthcare providers who recommend and administer vaccines, and the systems to make sure vaccines are safe.},

This study explores the impact of SIPOs on health, with particular attention to heterogeneity in their impacts. First, using daily state-level social distancing data from SafeGraph and a difference-indifferences approach, we document that adoption of a SIPO was associated with a 5 to 10 percent increase in the rate at which state residents remained in their homes full-time. Then, using daily state-level coronavirus case data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we find that approximately three weeks following the adoption of a SIPO, cumulative COVID-19 cases fell by 44 percent. Event-study analyses confirm common COVID-19 case trends in the week prior to SIPO adoption and show that SIPO-induced case reductions grew larger over time.

abstract = {We combine structural estimation with ideas from Machine Learning to estimate a model with information-based voluntary social distancing and state lockdowns to analyze the factors driving the effect of social distancing in mitigating COVID-19. The model allows us to estimate how contagious social interactions are by state and enables us to control for several unobservable, time-varying confounders such as asymptomatic transmission, sample selection in testing and quarantining, and time-varying fatality rates. We find that information-based voluntary social distancing has saved three times as many lives as lockdowns. Second, information policy effects are asymmetric: 'least informed' responses would have implied 240,000 more fatalities by June 2020 while 'most informed' responses would have saved 25,000 more lives. Third, our estimates suggest that contagion externalities from social interactions are large enough that a lockdown response could have been 25% less costly for the median state and still saved an equivalent number of lives.},

abstract = {Voluntary shelter-in-place directives and lockdowns are the main non-pharmaceutical interventions that governments around the globe have used to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. In this paper we study the impact of such interventions in the capital of a developing country, Santiago, Chile, that exhibits large socioeconomic inequality. A distinctive feature of our study is that we use granular geolocated mobile phone data to construct mobility measures that capture (1) shelter-in-place behavior, and (2) trips within the city to destinations with potentially different risk profiles. Using panel data linear regression models we first show that the impact of social distancing measures and lockdowns on mobility is highly heterogeneous and dependent on socioeconomic levels. More specifically , our estimates indicate that while zones of high socioeconomic levels can exhibit reductions in mobility of around 50% to 90% depending on the specific mobility metric used, these reductions are only 20% to 50% for lower-income communities. The large reductions in higher-income communities are significantly driven by voluntary shelter-in-place behavior. Second, also using panel data methods we show that our mobility measures are important predictors of infections: a 10% increase in mobility correlates with approximately a 5% increase in the rate of infection. Our results suggest that mobility is an important factor explaining differences in infections rates between high and low incomes areas within the city. Further, they confirm the challenges of reducing mobility in lower-income communities, where people generate their income from their daily work. To be effective, shelter-in-place restrictions in municipalities of low socioeconomic levels may need to be complemented by other supporting measures that enable their inhabitants to increase compliance.},

abstract = {There is a growing trend in the retail industry to improve customer experience. In this article, we study retailer-initiated strategies to increase consumer valuation for a product under duopoly. In such a setting, it is possible that a consumer's valuation may be increased by one retailer; however, the consumer may decide to buy the product from the competitor. We consider a two-stage game where retailers first decide whether to invest in improvements in customer valuation and then engage in price competition. We computationally explore the Nash equilibria in terms of both investment and pricing. We find that in the majority of cases retailers price in a manner to discourage their local customers to buy from the competitor. Next, we focus on the pricing game and theoretically characterize the pricing Nash equilibrium. We find that a retailer could overcome competitive effects by improving consumer valuation beyond a certain threshold. We also find that a retailer who does not invest could benefit from competition in situations where his competitor increases consumer valuation beyond a threshold. Finally, we explore through a computational study the Nash equilibria of the two-stage game using an alternate model to establish the robustness of our findings. {\textcopyright} 2013 Production and Operations Management Society.},

abstract = {Within the frame of decision aid literature, decision making problems with multiple sources of information have drawn the attention of researchers from a wide spectrum of disciplines. In decision situations with multiple individuals, each one has his own knowledge on the alternatives of the decision problem. The use of information assessed in different domains is not a seldom situation. This non-homogeneous information can be represented as values belonging to domains with different nature as linguistic, numerical and interval valued or can be values assessed in label sets with different granularity, multi-granular linguistic information. Decision processes for solving these problems are composed by two phases: aggregation and exploitation. The main problem to deal with non-homogeneous contexts is how to aggregate the information assessed in these contexts? In this paper, taking as base the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation model we shall develop an aggregation process for dealing with non-homogeneous contexts. In first place, we shall develop an aggregation process for combining numerical, interval valued and linguistic information, afterwards we shall propose different extensions of this process to deal with contexts in which can appear other type of information as intuitionistic fuzzy sets or multi-granular linguistic information.},

abstract = {After the cost of goods sold, store labor expense is the largest cost component in the retailing industry. As a result, developing and executing labor plans is a key task for retailers. In this paper we use private data provided by a large retail chain to assess the relationship between labor planning and execution practices and the average transaction (basket) value of a retail store location. We find that consumer basket value varies greatly from store to store and that there is a strong cross-sectional association between labor practices at different stores and basket values. In particular, matching labor deployment to store traffic (rather than to the forecast of sales, as many retailers currently do) is associated with larger basket values. We further separate the task of labor management into the planning component (i.e., creating a labor plan that matches traffic patterns) and the execution components (i.e., deploying part-time employees, full-time employees and managers to match the labor plan), and we find that stores with better plans and stores with better execution of these plans for full-time employees (but not for part-time employees) demonstrate significantly higher basket values. We obtain these results after controlling for customer demographics and product variety, which are also significant in explaining basket values. Our findings suggest that modest improvements in employee scheduling and in execution of the schedule can result in a 3% sales lift at moderate, or even no, additional cost.},

abstract = {Financial markets and macroeconomic environments are often characterised by positive external-ities. In these environments, transparency may reduce expected welfare: public announcements serve as focal points for higher-order beliefs and affect agents{\~{O}} behaviour more than justified by their informational contents. Some scholars conclude that reducing public signals{\~{O}} precision or entirely withholding information may improve welfare. This article shows that public information should always be provided with maximum precision but, under certain conditions, not to all agents. Restricting the degree of publicity is a better-suited instrument for preventing the negative welfare effects of public announcements than restrictions on their precision are. There is a general presumption that higher central bank transparency in terms of information disclosure to a wider audience improves the effectiveness of monetary policy and is beneficial to markets as it reduces information asymmetries, helps to assess risk better and arrive at more informed decisions, thus enhancing market efficiency. While practitioners (in central banks and international institutions) agree on the desirability of informative announcements and promote higher transparency on the ground that any information is valuable to markets, recent academic literature distinguishes private and public information and argues that public announcements may destabilise markets and reduce efficiency by their effects on higher-order beliefs, if markets are characterised by positive externalities. Morris and Shin (2002) (henceforth M-S) have shown that noisy public announcements may be detrimental to welfare from an ex ante point of view. They conclude that a commitment to withholding relevant information or deliberately reducing its precision may be welfare enhancing. In this article we challenge this conclusion by distinguishing two components of transparency: precision of information and degree of publicity. The degree of publicity is the proportion of agents who receive a signal. Using a stylised coordination game introduced by M-S, we show that information should always be provided to the market with maximum precision but, under certain conditions, the mechanisms of disseminating information should aim at limiting the degree of publicity by providing information only to some fraction of market participants. The optimal degree of publicity depends on the precision of announcements. If there are inevitable limits to the precision, the optimal degree of publicity is rising in precision and reaches one if precision is sufficiently high. The rationale for our results is that partial publicity increases expected utility for those who receive the information, while potentially detrimental effects on higher-order beliefs are limited if agents expect that others do not possess the same information. The literature distinguishes at least three different lines of arguments against central bank transparency. Within a Barro-Gordon framework, the inflation bias may be},

abstract = {Information, which can arrive in multiple forms, is a fundamental component of all financial transactions and markets. We define hard and soft information and describe the relative advantages of each. Hard information is quantitative, is easy to store, and can be transmitted in impersonal ways. Its information content is independent of its collection. As technology changes, the way we collect, process, and communicate information, it changes the structure of markets, the design of financial intermediaries, and the incentives to use or misuse information. We survey the literature to understand how information type influences the continued evolution of financial markets and institutions. Information is an essential component in all financial transactions and markets. A major purpose of financial markets and institutions is to collect, process, and transmit information. Given the importance of information and its transmission to the study of finance, as technology changes the way information is communicated, it also fundamentally changes financial markets, securities, and institutions, especially financial intermediaries. However, new technologies (i.e., those developed in the past 50 years) are more adept at transmitting and potentially processing information that is We thank the editors Efraim Benmelech and Paolo Fulghieri for their patience and guidance in bringing this paper to fruition.

While cost of labor is well understood, the revenue implications of having the right staffing level are hard to estimate. Moreover, these implications vary by store; hence, staffing levels should vary as well. Academic/practical relevance: We provide a novel method for setting store associate staffing at the individual store level. We discuss a field implementation that tested this methodology. Methodology: We use historical data on revenue and planned and actual staffing levels by store to estimate how revenue varies with the staffing level at each store. We disentangle the endogeneity between revenue and staffing levels by focusing on randomly occurring deviations between planned and actual labor. Using historical analysis as a guide, we validate these results by changing the staffing levels in a few test stores. We implement the results chain-wide and measure the impact in a large specialty retailer. Results: We find that the implementation validates predictions of the historical analysis. The implementation in 168 stores over six months produces a 4.5% revenue increase and a nearly $7.4 million annual profit increase. The impact of staffing level on revenue varies greatly by store. Managerial implications: Our paper makes three contributions to academic literature and to retail practice. First, we describe a process by which retailers can improve the most common industry practice: set store labor to be proportional to forecasted store revenue. Our proposed approach systematically sets the labor level in each store. Second, we demonstrate the effectiveness of that process via a field test and then via chain-wide implementation over a six-month time period. Finally, most retailers set store labor at the same level across stores, proportionate to revenue. We show that this is not the best approach because the revenue impact of store labor varies by store. The stores in our study that could benefit from relatively more labor were those with high potential demand, closely located competition for that demand, and experienced store managers. Overall, we provide the first simple but rigorous, field-tested approach that any retailer can use to increase revenue and profitability through better labor management.},

abstract = {After the cost of goods sold, store labor expense is the largest cost component in the retailing industry. As a result, developing and executing labor plans is a key task for retailers. In this paper we use private data provided by a large retail chain to assess the relationship between labor planning and execution practices and the average transaction (basket) value of a retail store location. We find that consumer basket value varies greatly from store to store and that there is a strong cross-sectional association between labor practices at different stores and basket values. In particular, matching labor deployment to store traffic (rather than to the forecast of sales, as many retailers currently do) is associated with larger basket values. We further separate the task of labor management into the planning component (i.e., creating a labor plan that matches traffic patterns) and the execution components (i.e., deploying part-time employees, full-time employees and managers to match the labor plan), and we find that stores with better plans and stores with better execution of these plans for full-time employees (but not for part-time employees) demonstrate significantly higher basket values. We obtain these results after controlling for customer demographics and product variety, which are also significant in explaining basket values. Our findings suggest that modest improvements in employee scheduling and in execution of the schedule can result in a 3% sales lift at moderate, or even no, additional cost.},

Problem definition: We consider the development of an efficient and scalable video-analytics approach to measure customer assistance and its mediating role in the relationship between staffing levels and revenues. Academic/practical relevance: Staffing decisions account for a large portion of a retailer's operational costs. Researchers have studied the extent to which an increase in staffing levels translates into greater revenues, without emphasizing the underlying mechanisms that generate this potential improvement , such as assisting customers. Methodology: We use econometric methods, including survival-analysis techniques, to analyze data gathered from in-store video recordings of customer visits to stores of a women's apparel chain. Results: We find that, under average store conditions, a 25% increase in labor yields a 16% increase in store revenues. An increase in the assistance of customers while searching, browsing, or trying products mediates approximately 50% of this increase, while the remainder originates from other activities, such as helping customers at the checkout counter. Moreover, we find that this form of assistance has a significant and positive impact on both conversion and ticket size. Managerial implications: Our approach can be used to explain heterogeneity in employee productivity across stores, to monitor and detect unexpected deviations in customer-assistance levels, and to measure the productivity of multitasking agents for the different functions that they perform.

Although effective in reducing staffing level, hence labor cost, the potential impact of just-in-time scheduling on workers' productivity and the firm's revenue is not well understood. Using a data set of 1,444,044 transactions from 25 stores of a full-service casual dining restaurant chain in the United States, we study how just-in-time scheduling impacts worker productivity. We consider two types of just-in-time schedules: (1) short-notice schedules that are assigned to servers shortly before the day of service (mostly two days in our data) and (2) real-time schedules that are assigned to servers on the day of service. We show that short-notice schedules do not harm server productivity overall, but real-time schedules do by 4.4%. Our analysis indicates this may be because servers reduce their up-selling and cross-selling efforts when working on real-time schedules. We then propose an analytical scheduling model that accounts for both the value of staffing flexibility created through just-in-time scheduling and its impact on server productivity to inform the firm how to use just-in-time scheduling to improve profitability. Through a case study, we demonstrate that with the 4.4% productivity loss during the real-time schedules, the managers should shift from the heavy use of real-time scheduling toward scheduling more servers with longer advance notice. Such a shift not only provides more predictable work schedules for the workers but can also improve restaurants' expected profit by up to 1%, a significant number for the low-margin restaurant industry.

@article{Perdikaki2017,
abstract = {The performance of a retail store depends on its ability to attract customer traffic, match labor with incoming traffic, and convert the incoming traffic into sales. Retailers make significant investments in marketing activities (such as advertising) to bring customers into their stores and in-store labor to convert that traffic into sales. Thus, a common trade-off that retail store managers face concerns the allocation of a store's limited budget between advertising and labor to enhance store-level sales. To explore that trade-off, we develop a centralized model to allocate limited store budget between store labor and advertising with the objective of maximizing store sales. We find that a store's inherent potential to drive traffic plays an important role, among other factors, in the relative allocation between advertising and store labor. We also find that as advertising instruments become more effective in bringing traffic to stores, managers should not always capitalize this effectiveness by increasing their existing allocations to advertising. In addition, we discuss a decentralized setting where budget allocation decisions cannot be enforced by a store manager and present a simple mechanism that can achieve the centralized solution. In an extension, we address the budget allocation problem in the presence of marketing efforts to shift store traffic from peak to off peak hours and show that our initial findings are robust. Further, we illustrate how the solution from the budget allocation model can be used to facilitate store level sales force planning/scheduling decisions. Based on the results of our model, we present several insights that can help managers in budget allocation and sales force planning.},

abstract = {Labor costs are one of the largest expenses of retail companies. This work develops a decision support tool to manage staffing levels and schedule working shifts, balancing the sales contribution of employees with salary costs. We extend recent empirical studies that estimate the impact of staffing levels on sales, combining detailed sales transaction and hourly customer traffic with employee staffing data. The empirical strategy uses exogenous deviations between the planned and actual schedule to identify the causal effect of staffing on conversion rates and basket value. This empirical model combined with traffic forecasting models are used as an input to a scheduling algorithm that optimizes the workforce schedule by balancing revenues with employee salaries, providing a feasible and detailed specification of working shifts that complies with labor regulations and other practical constraints. We also propose a robust optimization model to face uncertainties coming from the parameter estimation. The methodology is tested using real data from a children apparel retail chain in Latin America. The results suggest that most stores are understaffed during the weekends and at the same time overstaffed during lunch hours in weekdays, which is in part explained by the reduced flexibility imposed by regulatory restrictions for full-time workers.

With the goal of improving staffing decisions and store performance, we develop a labor-planning framework using proprietary data from an apparel retail chain. First, we propose a sales response function based on labor adequacy (the labor to traffic ratio) that exhibits variable elasticity of substitution between traffic and labor. When compared to a frequently used function with constant elasticity of substitution, our proposed function exploits information content from data more effectively and better predicts sales under extreme labor/traffic conditions. We use the validated sales response function to develop a data-driven staffing heuristic that incorporates the prediction loss function and uses past traffic to predict optimal labor. In counterfactual experimentation, we show that profits achieved by our heuristic are within 0.5% of the optimal (attainable if perfect traffic information was available) under stable traffic conditions, and within 2.5% of the optimal under extreme traffic variability. We conclude by discussing implications of our findings for researchers and practitioners.},

Problem definition: Brick-and-mortar (B&M) retailers must enhance the customer in-store experience to better compete with online retailers. Fitting rooms in B&M stores play a critical role in the customer experience as a venue to experience products and examine alternatives. High traffic in fitting rooms, however, obstructs the customer's ability to choose a product. In this paper, we (1) examine the impact of fitting room traffic on store performance using archival data, (2) identify phantom stockouts as a plausible mechanism for this impact, and (3) provide a potential solution and quantify the magnitude of its impact using two field experiments. Academic/practical relevance: The consumer purchase decision process framework has been widely used in disciplines such as marketing and information systems. We consider the impact of high traffic in fitting rooms on customer's purchase decision process. We show that high traffic in fitting rooms affects store sales negatively as it can obstruct customers' ability to perform information search, evaluation of alternatives, or both. Methodology: We use archival data analysis, a field study, and a field experiment to demonstrate our findings. Results: We demonstrate an inverted-U relationship between fitting room traffic and sales using archival data analysis. Our field study reveals that high traffic in fitting rooms exacerbates phantom stockouts, which could contribute to the decline in sales. Finally, through field experiments at two retailers, we show that a timely backend recovery operation through a dedicated fitting room associate reduces phantom stockouts and increases sales by 22.4%-22.7%. Managerial implications: First, contrary to conventional wisdom that traffic drives sales, we identify that fitting room traffic beyond a certain point can hurt store sales. Second, we find a large magnitude of phantom stockouts in fitting rooms. Finally, we show that dedicated fitting room labor can significantly boost store sales by alleviating phantom stockouts.

These results can be explained by two simultaneous phenomena: (1) additional store sales from customers who use the BOPS functionality and buy additional products in the stores (cross-selling effect) and (2) the shift of some customers from the online to the brick-and-mortar channel and the conversion of noncustomers into store customers (channel-shift effect). We explain these channel-shift patterns as an increase in "research online, purchase offline" behavior enabled by BOPS implementation, and we validate this explanation with evidence from the change of cart abandonment and conversion rates of the brick-and-mortar and online channels.

abstract = {In this note, we propose the use of sparse methods (e.g. LASSO, Post-LASSO, √ LASSO, and Post-√ LASSO) to form first-stage predictions and estimate optimal instruments in linear instrumental variables (IV) models with many instruments in the canonical Gaussian case. The methods apply even when the number of instruments is much larger than the sample size. We derive asymptotic distributions for the resulting IV estimators and provide conditions under which these sparsity-based IV estimators are asymptotically oracle-efficient. In simulation experiments, a sparsity-based IV estimator with a data-driven penalty performs well compared to recently advocated many-instrument-robust procedures. We illustrate the procedure in an empirical example using the Angrist and Krueger (1991) schooling data.},

abstract = {Our framework for understanding advice-taking in decision making rests on two theoretical concepts that motivate the studies and serve to explain the findings. The first is egocentric discounting of others' opinions and the second is reputation formation for advisors. Advice discounting is attributed to differential information, namely, the notion that decision makers have privileged access to their internal reasons for holding their own opinion , but not to the advisors' internal reasons. Reputation formation is related to the negativity effect in impression formation and to the trust asymmetry principle. In three studies we measured decision makers' weighting policy for advice and, in a fourth study, their willingness to pay for it. Briefly, we found that advice is discounted relative to one's own opinion, while advisors' reputations are rapidly formed and asymmetrically revised. The asymmetry implies that it may be easier for advisors to lose a good reputation than to gain one. The cognitive and social origins of these phenomena are considered. Taking advice is a central component of realistic decision making, since decision problems generally do not come as complete textbook problems with the relevant information as givens. Instead, decision makers engage in interactive processes in order to build the relevant informational basis. In particular, they solicit the opinions of worthy advisors, assess the merit of each opinion, and combine them. Examples include asking a fellow bus passenger about a street address, consulting a colleague's opinion for a research project, and genetic counseling regarding reproductive decisions.

abstract = {Demand forecasting is a crucial aspect of the planning process in supply-chain companies. The most common approach to forecasting demand in these companies involves the use of a computerized forecasting system to produce initial forecasts and the subsequent judgmental adjustment of these forecasts by the company's demand planners, ostensibly to take into account exceptional circumstances expected over the planning horizon. Making these adjustments can involve considerable management effort and time, but do they improve accuracy, and are some types of adjustment more effective than others? To investigate this, we collected data on more than 60,000 forecasts and outcomes from four supply-chain companies. In three of the companies, on average, judgmental adjustments increased accuracy. However, a detailed analysis revealed that, while the relatively larger adjustments tended to lead to greater average improvements in accuracy, the smaller adjustments often damaged accuracy. In addition, positive adjustments, which involved adjusting the forecast upwards, were much less likely to improve accuracy than negative adjustments. They were also made in the wrong direction more frequently, suggesting a general bias towards optimism. Models were then developed to eradicate such biases. Based on both this statistical analysis and organisational observation, the paper goes on to analyse strategies designed to enhance the effectiveness of judgmental adjustments directly.},

These variations include: the presence/absence of a pre-advice decision, the number of advisors, the amount of interaction between the decision-maker and the advisor(s) and also among advisors themselves, whether the decision-maker can choose if and when to access advice, and the type of decision-task. Several ways of measuring advice utilization are subsequently contrasted, and the conventional operationalization of ''advice'' itself is questioned.

abstract = {Recent research has suggested that consumers have in-store slack for grocery trips-that is, they leave room in their mental budgets to make unplanned purchases. Drawing on this work, this article examines how the impact of promotions depends on whether the shopper still has in-store slack remaining in his or her mental budget. Specifically, the authors evaluate how the effect of promotional savings for both planned and unplanned items on spending varies as a function of whether the item is purchased before or after the shopper's in-store slack is depleted. In addition, they examine how these relationships vary depending on income. To achieve these goals, the authors conducted a field study in which respondents used a handheld scanner to record the order of purchases. The results suggest that savings on planned items lead to stockpiling by higher-income shoppers when the savings occur before the in-store slack has been depleted but lead to increased purchase of unplanned items when they occur after in-store slack is depleted. The results also show that promotions on unplanned grocery items generate incremental spending at the basket level, which increases with income but only when the item is purchased after the in-store slack is exceeded. The authors discuss implications for shopper marketing strategies.},

abstract = {We develop results for the use of Lasso and Post-Lasso methods to form first-stage predictions and estimate optimal instruments in linear instrumental variables (IV) models with many instruments, $p$. Our results apply even when $p$ is much larger than the sample size, $n$. We show that the IV estimator based on using Lasso or Post-Lasso in the first stage is root-n consistent and asymptotically normal when the first-stage is approximately sparse; i.e. when the conditional expectation of the endogenous variables given the instruments can be well-approximated by a relatively small set of variables whose identities may be unknown. We also show the estimator is semi-parametrically efficient when the structural error is homoscedastic. Notably our results allow for imperfect model selection, and do not rely upon the unrealistic "beta-min" conditions that are widely used to establish validity of inference following model selection. In simulation experiments, the Lasso-based IV estimator with a data-driven penalty performs well compared to recently advocated many-instrument-robust procedures. In an empirical example dealing with the effect of judicial eminent domain decisions on economic outcomes, the Lasso-based IV estimator outperforms an intuitive benchmark. In developing the IV results, we establish a series of new results for Lasso and Post-Lasso estimators of nonparametric conditional expectation functions which are of independent theoretical and practical interest. We construct a modification of Lasso designed to deal with non-Gaussian, heteroscedastic disturbances which uses a data-weighted $\ell_1$-penalty function. Using moderate deviation theory for self-normalized sums, we provide convergence rates for the resulting Lasso and Post-Lasso estimators that are as sharp as the corresponding rates in the homoscedastic Gaussian case under the condition that $\log p = o(n^{1/3})$.},

This Health Policy paper compares three types of health systems (ie, with stronger investments in global health security, stronger investments in universal health coverage, and integrated investments in global health security and universal health coverage) in their response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and synthesises four essential recommendations (ie, integration, financing, resilience, and equity) to reimagine governance, policies, and investments for better health towards a more sustainable future.},

We find that an increase in the Twitter index of social distancing on day t-1 is associated with a decrease in mobility on day t. We also find that state orders, an increase in the number of COVID cases, precipitation and temperature contribute to reducing human mobility. Republican states are also less likely to enforce social distancing. Beliefs shared on social networks could both reveal the behavior of individuals and influence the behavior of others.

abstract = {This paper examines the impact of the social distancing policies states adopted between March and April of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 epidemic. These actions, together with voluntary social distancing, appear to have reduced the rate of new COVID-19 cases and deaths, but raised concerns about the costs experienced by workers and businesses. Estimates from difference-indifference models that leverage cross-state variation in the timing of business closures and stay-at-home mandates suggest that the employment rate fell by about 1.7 percentage points for every extra 10 days that a state experienced a stay-at-home mandate during the period March 12-April 12, 2020; select business closure laws were associated with similar employment effects. Our estimates imply that about 40% of the 12 percentage point decline in employment rates between January and April 2020 was due to a nationwide shock while about 60% was driven by state social distancing policies. The negative employment effects of state policies were larger for workers in "non-essential" industries, workers without a college degree, and early-career workers. Policy caused relatively modest changes in hours worked and earnings among those who remain employed. We find no concerning evidence of pre-trends in the monthly (low-frequency) CPS data, but use high-frequency data on work-related mobility measured from cellphones, job-loss-related internet searches, and initial unemployment claims to investigate the possibility that the large employment effects experienced in April could have occurred after the March CPS but but before policy adoption. In those analyses, we find pre-trends for some outcomes but not others. Thus we cannot fully rule out that some employment effects shortly predated the policies. As states relax business closures, ensuring gains in labor market activities in ways that continue to mitigate COVID-19 "surges" and public health risks will be key considerations to monitor.},

Abstract The goal of this piece is to survey the emerging and rapidly growing literature on the economic consequences of COVID-19 and governmental responses, and to synthetize the insights emerging from a very large number of studies. This survey (i) provides an overview of the data sets used to measure social distancing and COVID-19 cases and deaths; (ii) reviews the literature on the determinants of compliance and effectiveness of social distancing; (iii) summarizes the literature on the socioeconomic consequences of COVID-19 and governmental interventions, focusing on labor, health, gender, discrimination and environmental aspects; and (iv) discusses policy proposals.},

abstract = {The U.S. health care system has experienced great pressure since early March 2020 as it pivoted to providing necessary care for COVID-19 patients. But there are signs that non-COVID-19 care use declined during this time period. We examine near real time data from a nationwide electronic healthcare records system that covers over 35 million patients to provide new evidence of how non-COVID-19 acute care and preventive/primary care have been affected during the epidemic. Using event study and difference-indifference models we find that state closure policies (stay-at-home or non-essential business closures) are associated with large declines in ambulatory visits, with effects differing by type of care. State closure policies reduced overall outpatient visits by about 15-16 percent within two weeks. Outpatient visits for health checkups and well care experience very large declines during the epidemic, with substantial effects from state closure policies. In contrast, mental health outpatient visits declined less than other care, and appear less affected by state closure policies. We find substitution to telehealth modalities may have played an important role in mitigating the decline in mental health care utilization. Aggregate trends in outpatient visits show a 40% decline after the first week of March 2020, only a portion of which is attributed to state policy. A rebound starts around mid April that does not appear to be explained by state reopening policy. Despite this rebound, care visits still remain below the pre-epidemic levels in most cases.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has forced federal, state and local policymakers to respond by legislating, enacting, and enforcing social distancing policies. However, the impact of these policies on healthcare utilization in the United States has been largely unexplored. We examine the impact of county-level shelter in place ordinances on healthcare utilization using two unique datasets-employer-sponsored insurance for over 6 million people in the US and cell phone location data. We find that introduction of these policies was associated with reductions in the use of preventive care, elective care, and the number of weekly visits to physician offices and hospitals. However, controlling for county-level exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic reduces the impact of these policies. Our results imply that while social distancing policies do lead to reductions in healthcare utilization, much of these reductions would have occurred even in the absence of these policies.},

Good discussion. They use "time since first Covid" as a metric for the county's level of exposure to Covid, which might be driving the reduction in healthcare utilization


Our results imply that while SIP policies do lead to reductions in preventive and elective care, much of these reductions would have occurred even in the absence of these policies.},

abstract = {For much of 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic upended social and economic life globally. In an effort to reduce COVID-19 risks in the U.S., state and local governments issued many recommendations and regulations to induce social distancing, adding to voluntary reductions in interpersonal contact. The responses to the epidemic helped contain spread, but also lead to high unintended societal costs. In the summer months, states took steps to revive the economy and lift social distancing regulations. However, as many epidemiologists expected, the scale of the epidemic has expanded very rapidly in the fall. In the week of October 14, the US generated around 57,000 new COVID-19 cases and 700 deaths each day. By November 15, the country was generating about 151,000 new cases and 1,200 deaths per day. These rapid increases in cases and deaths raise concerns about the capacity of local healthcare systems around the country. State governments are once again facing difficult choices about whether and how to use policies to address the spread of the virus. The incoming Biden-Harris administration faces an important challenge in trying to manage the epidemic as well as a large scale vaccination campaign. Although the epidemic is less than a year old, it has generated a huge volume of research by economists, epidemiologists, and others. This body of work may help inform policy decisions facing society in the coming months. In this paper, we make five broad contributions. First, we provide a concise review of economic and social science research on mobility patterns, labor market outcomes, consumer behavior, and population health during the first phase of the epidemic. Second, we sketch a simple microeconomic model that may be useful considering the determinants of social distancing and the role of different policy instruments in promoting distancing. Third, we present a simple typology of the policies that were used at the state and county levels during the closure and reopening phases of the epidemic in the U.S.. Fourth, we review a collection of new data sources that have played an important role in monitoring and analyzing population behavior this year. Fifth, we present results from event study regressions that try to disentangle private vs. policy-induced changes in mobility patterns during the early part of the epidemic.},

abstract = {Social interactions and social preferences play a central role in public health domains. In the face of a pandemic, individuals adjust their behavior, whereas in SIR models infection rates are typically exogenous. City-level data across countries suggest that mobility falls in response to fear, proxied by Google searches. Incorporating experimentally validated measures of social preferences at the regional level, we find that stringency measures matter less when individuals are more patient, altruistic, or exhibit less negative reciprocity. To account for these findings, we extend homogeneous and networked SIR models by endogenizing agents' social-activity intensity and incorporating social preferences. Our quantitative predictions markedly differ from those of the na{\"{i}}ve SIR network model. We derive the planner's problem, and show that neglecting agents' endogenous response leads to misguided policy decisions of various non-pharmaceutical interventions. Any further mobility restrictions, beyond agents' restraint, result from aggregate externalities which are curtailed by social preferences.},

abstract = {The collapse of economic activity in 2020 from COVID-19 has been immense. An important question is how much of that collapse resulted from government-imposed restrictions versus people voluntarily choosing to stay home to avoid infection. This paper examines the drivers of the economic slowdown using cellular phone records data on customer visits to more than 2.25 million individual businesses across 110 different industries. Comparing consumer behavior over the crisis within the same commuting zones but across state and county boundaries with different policy regimes suggests that legal shutdown orders account for only a modest share of the massive changes to consumer behavior (and that tracking county-level policy conditions is significantly more accurate than using state-level policies alone). While overall consumer traffic fell by 60 percentage points, legal restrictions explain only 7 percentage points of this. Individual choices were far more important and seem tied to fears of infection. Traffic started dropping before the legal orders were in place; was highly influenced by the number of COVID deaths reported in the county; and showed a clear shift by consumers away from busier, more crowded stores toward smaller, less busy stores in the same industry. States that repealed their shutdown orders saw symmetric, modest recoveries in consumer visits, further supporting the small estimated effect of policy. Although the shutdown orders had little aggregate impact, they did have a significant effect in reallocating consumer visits away from ''nonessential" to ''essential" businesses and from restaurants and bars toward groceries and other food sellers. {\'{O}} 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V. The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its associated COVID-19 disease has had unprecedented effects on economic activity around the world. In an effort to limit the spread of the disease, many governments adopted stay-at-home/shelter-in-place orders. That ignited a debate over ''re-opening" and whether the health benefits from the orders' impact on slowing the spread of the virus outweighed the economic damage they did. It is not clear, however, that the economic decline actually came from the lockdown orders. Those lockdown orders were an endogenous policy response to the arrival of the disease. By many accounts, anxious individuals engaged in physical distancing on their own accord and understanding the size of that effect is critical for evaluating the policy question. If fear rather than policy drives the economics, the economic stimulus from repealing the orders may be considerably smaller than some might predict. In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of government policy on the economy during the initial spread of COVID-19 in the U. S. using data on foot traffic at 2.25 million individual businesses. Our empirical strategy separates the effects of voluntary distancing from that of policy orders by comparing differences in foot traffic across businesses within commuting zones that span jurisdictions facing differing legal restrictions. This leverages two related types of variation: businesses in border-spanning commuting zones where jurisdictions impose of shelter-in-place orders at different times (e.g., northern Illinois when Illinois placed a sheltering order on March 20th while Wisconsin waited until the following week), and businesses in commuting zones where a jurisdiction never imposed an order (e.g., the Quad Cities area, where the Illinois towns of Moline and Rock Island faced stay-at-home orders but bordering Davenport and Bettendorf, Iowa did not).},

abstract = {PURPOSE This study was conducted to document current immunization practices by family physicians. METHODS In 2008 the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) conducted a survey among a random sample of 2,000 of its members who reported spending 80% or more of their time in direct patient care. The survey consisted of questions regarding the demographics of the practice, vaccines that are provided at the physicians' clinical site, whether the practice refers patients elsewhere for vaccines, and participation in the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. RESULTS The response rate was 38.5%, 31.8% after non-offi ce-based respondents were deleted. A high proportion of respondents (80% or more) reported providing most routinely recommended child, adolescent, and adult vaccines at their practice sites. The exceptions were rotavirus vaccine for children and herpes zoster vaccine for adults., A signifi cant proportion, however, reported referring elsewhere for some vaccines (44.1% for children and adolescent vaccines and 53.5% for adult vaccines), with the most frequent referral location being a public health department. A higher proportion of solo and 2-physician practices than larger practices reported referring patients. A lack of adequate payment was listed as the reason for referring patients elsewhere for vaccines by one-half of those who refer patients. One-half of responders do not participate in the VFC program. CONCLUSIONS Provision of recommended vaccines by most family physicians remains an important service. Smaller practices have more diffi culty offering a full array of vaccine products, and lack of adequate payment contributes to referring patients outside the medical home. The reasons behind the lack of participation in the VFC program deserve further study.},

abstract = {Background: Family physicians (FPs) play an important role in influenza vaccination. We investigated how local FP supply is associated with influenza vaccination, controlling for both individual-level and county-level characteristics. Methods: The 2008-2010 individual-level data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were merged with county-level data from the Area Resource File (n ¼ 985,157). Multivariate logistic analyses were performed to predict influenza vaccination using the number of FPs per 1000 population as the key predictor, adjusting for individual-level demographic, socioeconomic, and health information, as well as county-level racial composition and income level. Additional analyses were performed across racial/ ethnic and employment status categories. Results: Increasing local FP supply was associated with higher odds (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49-1.67) and varied across racial/ethnic groups (Hispanic: aOR, 2.05, 95% CI, 1.55-2.72; non-Hispanic white: aOR, 1.57, 95% CI, 1.48-1.66; non-Hispanic black: aOR, 1.49, 95% CI, 1.18-1.89), employment status categories, and county types. Conclusions: FP supply was significantly associated with influenza vaccination. The association was greatest among those who were Hispanic, residing in a rural area, or out of work. Our findings lend support to initiatives aimed at increasing the FP supply, particularly among disadvantaged populations. Influenza vaccination is a cost-effective preventive service 1-3 and a core component of any preventive service packages. 3,4 Maciosek et al 1 found that approximately 275,000 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) would be saved if influenza vaccination were offered annually to all persons age 50 years and older. After considering the cost-effectiveness and serious health and cost consequences of influenza vaccination, in 2010 the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended annual influenza vaccination for all persons age 6 months and older in the United States. The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) required insurance policies beginning on or after September 23, 2010, to provide full coverage of influenza vaccination with no copayment or coinsurance. Despite its effectiveness and low costs, however, influenza vaccination rates remain low in the United States. The Healthy People 2020 targets include achieving influenza vaccination rates of 90% in adults aged 65 years and older and 80% in adults aged 18-64 years, 4 but the actual rates during the 2012-2013 influenza season were only 66.2% and 35.7%, respectively. 5 Large racial/ethnic disparities also remain. During the 2012-2013 season, among adults aged 65 and older, 67.9% of non-Hispanic whites were vaccinated, compared with 54.5% of non-Hispanic blacks. 5 Of note, the low vaccination rates and racial/ethnic disparities exist in other years as well. Numerous studies have explored possible predictors and causes of low influenza vaccination rates. This area of research is critical for understanding differing prevalence rates and for designing sound public health policies to promote preventive care. In addition to individual-level factors, including socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, general health status, and perceived risks and benefits of influenza vaccination, recent studies have identified contextual/neighborhood characteristics, such as racial/ethnic composition and neighborhood socioeconomic status, as important factors affecting individual decisions as well.},

abstract = {Organizational scandals have become all too commonplace; from investment firms' financial improprieties to sexual abuse cover-ups, rule-breaking has become a "nor- mal" feature of organizational life. Although there is considerable scholarly work on rule-breaking, efforts to explain it remain theoretically fragmented. Here we identify two fundamental dimensions of bureaucratic rule-breaking and develop a coherent theoretical conception of it as a structurally patterned and interactionally mediated sociological fact. First, rule-breaking may be permitted or contested by those charged with rule enforcement. Manifestations of rule-breaking take on a routine character only where it is unofficially allowed; where it is not, conflict ensues. Second, the hierarchical structure of bureaucracy is mirrored by an organizational hierarchy of rule-breaking. Rule-breaking can be undertaken by individuals acting alone, it can be coordinated by workgroups, or it can be organized by top management as a matter of unofficial policy. Considering how these two dimensions of rule-breaking interact provides insight into how such actions vary with respect to the full range of organi- zational cross-pressures. Finally, the framework we develop offers an important corrective to the overreliance on the formal aspects of Weber's theorizing about bureaucracy and has considerable utility for generating hypotheses across an array of institutional arenas.},

abstract = {Problem definition: We study a compliance problem of healthcare workers (HCWs) in hospitals where hand hygiene compliance rates are generally low. We first analyze how peer effects impact compliance decisions of HCWs and then analyze how monitoring can improve compliance. Academic/practical relevance: Inducing process compliance of human operators is an ongoing challenge in operations management with significant implications on the productivity and the quality of the products or services rendered by standardized processes. In healthcare, low hand hygiene compliance ofHCWs is the leading cause of hospital-acquired infections, which can be largely prevented by HCWs following standardized hand hygiene processes. Methodology: Using a game- theoretical approach, we model HCWs' reactions to peers' (non-)compliance to determine their equilibrium compliance levels. We integrate the model with a disease-transmission model to determine how the compliance affects disease prevalence in a hospital ward. Results: When the process compliance is endogenous, HCWs play a mixed strategy in equilibrium between complying and noncomplying. We establish that a macrolevel hand hygiene compliance rate of HCWs can result from a combination of four different types of microlevel noncompliance: free-riding, safe-playing, self-regarding, and opportunistic behaviors. Finally, we show that the marginal effect of monitoring on reducing disease prevalence depends on clinical factors, HCWs' interpersonal learning, and other inte- gration factors like goal setting. Managerial implications: The results demonstrate that the monitoring intervention may not effectively prevent disease transmission without un- derstanding the microlevel behaviors of noncompliant HCWs. Our results provide an explanation as to why there is a significant variability in the effectiveness of management intervention as observed in practice.},

Empirical evidence from the field shows that even a modest increase in group-level privacy sustainably and significantly improves line performance, while qualitative evidence suggests that privacy is important in supporting productive deviance, localized experimentation , distraction avoidance, and continuous improvement.

abstract = {Evidence of the health-promoting influence of primary care has been accumulating ever since researchers have been able to distinguish primary care from other aspects of the health services delivery system. This evidence shows that primary care helps prevent illness and death, regardless of whether the care is characterized by supply of primary care physicians, a relationship with a source of primary care, or the receipt of important features of primary care. The evidence also shows that primary care (in contrast to specialty care) is associated with a more equitable distribution of health in populations, a finding that holds in both cross-national and within-national studies. The means by which primary care improves health have been identified, thus suggesting ways to improve overall health and reduce differences in health across major population subgroups. {\textcopyright} 2005 Milbank Memorial Fund.

abstract = {PURPOSE Recent evidence shows a national decline in primary care visit rates over the last decade. It is unclear how changes in practice—including the use and content of primary care visits—may have contributed. METHODS We analyzed nationally representative data of adult visits to primary care physicians (PCPs) and physician practice characteristics from 2007–2016 (National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey). United States census estimates were used to calculate visits per capita. Measures included visit rates per person year; visit duration; number of medications, diagnoses, and preventive services per visit; percentage of visits with scheduled follow-up; and percentage of physicians with practice capabilities including an electronic medical record (EMR). RESULTS Our weighted sample represented 3.2 billion visits (83,368 visits, unweighted). Visits per capita declined by 20% (–0.25 visits per person, 95% CI, –0.32 to –0.19) during this time, while visit duration increased by 2.4 minutes per visit (95% CI, 1.1-3.8). Per visit, PCPs addressed 0.30 more diagnoses (95% CI, 0.16-0.43) and 0.82 more medications (95% CI, 0.59-1.1), and provided 0.24 more preventive services (95% CI, 0.12-0.36). Visits with scheduled PCP follow-up declined by 6.0% (95% CI, –12.4 to 0.46), while PCPs reporting use of EMR increased by 44.3% (95% CI, 39.1-49.5) and those reporting use of secure messaging increased by 60.9% (95% CI, 27.5-94.3). CONCLUSION From 2008 to 2015, primary care visits were longer, addressed more issues per visit, and were less likely to have scheduled follow-up for certain patients and conditions. Meanwhile, more PCPs offered non–face-to-face care. The decline in primary care visit rates may be explained in part by PCPs offering more comprehensive in-person visits and using more non–face-to-face care.},

@article{Friedberg2010,
abstract = {Despite contentious debate over the new national health care reform law, there is an emerging consensus that strengthening primary care will improve health outcomes and restrain the growth of health care spending. Policy discussions imply three general definitions of primary care: a specialty of medical providers, a set of functions served by a usual source of care, and an orientation of health systems. We review the empirical evidence linking each definition of primary care to health care quality, outcomes, and costs. The available evidence most directly supports initiatives to increase providers' ability to serve primary care functions and to reorient health systems to emphasize delivery of primary care. P olicy makers, professional organizations , and purchasers of health care have reached an unusual consensus on the importance of revitalizing primary care. This consensus stems from agreement that primary care is in a deepening crisis, but that effective primary care can improve health outcomes and contain health care costs. Some proposed solutions frame the crisis as a problem of insufficient numbers of primary care physicians. This framing rests on evidence that U.S. medical students are losing interest in primary care careers and that Medicare beneficiaries are beginning to report difficulty finding new primary care physicians. 1,2 Large income differences between specialties may deter medical students from pursuing careers in primary care. 3 This has prompted the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) to recommend a budget-neutral payment increase for "primary care services provided by practitioners who focus on primary care." 2 Other proposals frame the primary care crisis as one of insufficient capability. These proposals include efforts to not only expand the number of patients who have a primary care provider, but also to give these providers new resources such as electronic health records and nonphysician care coordinators. The medical home and Chronic Care Model include sets of interventions intended to enhance and extend the capabilities of primary care providers. 4,5 A third set of proposals attempts to reorient entire health care delivery systems toward primary care. Such proposals call for rebalancing primary and specialty care in the United States-a goal that may require interventions beyond increasing the number of primary care physicians. 6 These proposals also call for basing system-level payment and organizational design on core principles of primary care. 7 Given the magnitude of the investment necessary to revitalize primary care, it is fair to ask what evidence supports current proposals to expand , equip, and empower primary care. In this paper we review the empirical evidence linking primary care to the quality, outcomes, and costs of health care; evaluate the strength of this evidence; and discuss the resulting policy implications.},

abstract = {Background: Primary care is known to improve outcomes and lower health care costs, prompting recent U.S. policy efforts to expand its role. Nonetheless, there is early evidence of a decline in per capita primary care visit rates, and little is understood about what is contributing to the decline. Objective: To describe primary care provider (PCP) visit trends among adults enrolled with a large, national, commercial insurer and assess factors underlying a potential decline in PCP visits. Design: Descriptive repeated cross-sectional study using 100% deidentified claims data from the insurer, 2008–2016. A 5% claims sample was used for Poisson regression models to quantify visit trends. Setting: National, population-based. Participants: Adult health plan members aged 18 to 64 years. Measurements: PCP visit rates per 100 member-years. Results: In total, 142 million primary care visits among 94 million member-years were examined. Visits to PCPs declined by 24.2%, from 169.5 to 134.3 visits per 100 member-years, while the proportion of adults with no PCP visits in a given year rose from 38.1% to 46.4%. Rates of visits addressing low-acuity conditions decreased by 47.7% (95% CI, -48.1% to -47.3%). The decline was largest among the youngest adults (-27.6% [CI, -28.2% to -27.1%]), those without chronic conditions (-26.4% [CI, -26.7% to -26.1%]), and those living in the lowest-income areas (-31.4% [CI, -31.8% to -30.9%]). Out-of-pocket cost per problem-based visit rose by $9.4 (31.5%). Visit rates to specialists remained stable (-0.08% [CI, -0.56% to 0.40%]), and visits to alternative venues, such as urgent care clinics, increased by 46.9% (CI, 45.8% to 48.1%). Limitation: Data were limited to a single commercial insurer and did not capture nonbilled clinician–patient interactions. Conclusion: Commercially insured adults have been visiting PCPs less often, and nearly one half had no PCP visits in a given year by 2016. Our results suggest that this decline may be explained by decreased real or perceived visit needs, financial deterrents, and use of alternative sources of care.},

abstract = {Importance: The US health care system is typically organized around hospitals and specialty care. The value of primary care remains unclear and debated. Objective: To determine whether an association exists between receipt of primary care and high-value services, low-value services, and patient experience. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a nationally representative analysis of noninstitutionalized US adults 18 years or older who participated in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Propensity score-weighted quality and experience of care were compared between 49286 US adults with and 21133 adults without primary care from 2012 to 2014. Temporal trends were also analyzed from 2002 to 2014. Exposures: Patient-reported receipt of primary care, determined by the 4 "Cs" of primary care: first-contact care that is comprehensive, continuous, and coordinated. Main Outcomes and Measures: Thirty-nine clinical quality measures and 7 patient experience measures aggregated into 10 clinical quality composites (6 high-value and 4 low-value services), an overall patient experience rating, and 2 experience composites. Results: From 2002 to 2014, the mean annual survey response rate was 58% (range, 49%-65%). Between 2012 and 2014, compared with respondents without primary care (before adjustment), those with primary care were older (50 [95% CI, 50-51] vs 38 [95% CI, 38-39] years old), more often female (55% [95% CI, 54%-55%] vs 42% [95% CI, 41%-43%]), and predominately white individuals (50% [95% CI, 49%-52%] vs 43% [95% CI, 41%-45%]). After propensity score weighting, US adults with or without primary care had the same mean numbers of outpatient (6.7 vs 5.9; difference, 0.8 [95% CI, -0.2 to 1.8]; P =.11), emergency department (0.2 for both; difference, 0.0 [95% CI, -0.1 to 0.0]; P =.17), and inpatient (0.1 for both; difference, 0.0 [95% CI, 0.0-0.0]; P =.92) encounters annually, but those with primary care filled more prescriptions (mean, 14.1 vs 10.7; difference, 3.4 [95% CI, 2.0-4.7]; P <.001) and were more likely to have a routine preventive visit in the past year (mean, 72.2% vs 57.5%; difference, 14.7% [95% CI, 12.3%-17.1%]; P <.001). From 2012 to 2014, Americans with primary care received more high-value care in 4 of 5 composites. For example, 78% of those with primary care received high-value cancer screening compared with 67% without primary care (difference, 10.8% [95% CI, 8.5%-13.0%]; P <.001). Americans with or without primary care received low-value care with similar frequencies on 3 of 4 composites, although Americans with primary care received more low-value antibiotics (59% vs 48%; difference, 11.0% [95% CI, 2.8%-19.3%] P <.001). Respondents with primary care also reported significantly better health care access and experience. For example, physician communication was highly rated for a greater proportion of those with (64%) vs without (54%) primary care (difference, 10.2%; 95% CI, 7.2%-13.1%; P <.001). Differences in quality and experience between Americans with or without primary care were essentially stable between 2002 and 2014. Conclusions and Relevance: Receipt of primary care was associated with significantly more high-value care, slightly more low-value care, and better health care experience. Policymakers and health system leaders seeking to improve value should consider increasing investments in primary care..},

abstract = {Objective: To examine the association between 10-year temporal changes in the primary care workforce and Medicare beneficiaries' outcomes. Data Sources: 2001 and 2011 American Medical Association Masterfiles and fee-for-service Medicare claims. Study Design/Methods: We calculated two primary care workforce measures within Primary Care Service Areas: the number of primary care physicians per 10,000 population (per capita) and the number of Medicare primary care full-time equivalents (FTEs) per 10,000 Medicare beneficiaries. The three outcomes were mortality, ambulatory care–sensitive condition (ACSC) hospitalizations, and emergency department (ED) visits. We measured the marginal association between changes in primary care workforce and patient outcomes using Poisson regression models. Principal Findings: An increase of one primary care physician per 10,000 population was associated with 15.1 fewer deaths per 100,000 and 39.7 fewer ACSC hospitalizations per 100,000 (both p <.05). An increase of one Medicare primary care FTE per 10,000 beneficiaries was associated with 82.8 fewer deaths per 100,000, 160.8 fewer ACSC hospitalizations per 100,000, and 712.3 fewer ED visits per 100,000 (all p <.05).

It remains unclear how much improving primary care physician supply can improve population health, independent of other health care and socioeconomic factors. Objectives: To identify primary care physician supply changes across US counties from 2005-2015 and associations between such changes and population mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This epidemiological study evaluated US population data and individual-level claims data linked to mortality from 2005 to 2015 against changes in primary care and specialist physician supply from 2005 to 2015. Data from 3142 US counties, 7144 primary care service areas, and 306 hospital referral regions were used to investigate the association of primary care physician supply with changes in life expectancy and cause-specific mortality after adjustment for health care, demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral covariates. Analysis was performed from March to July 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Age-standardized life expectancy, cause-specific mortality, and restricted mean survival time. Results: Primary care physician supply increased from 196014 physicians in 2005 to 204419 in 2015. Owing to disproportionate losses of primary care physicians in some counties and population increases, the mean (SD) density of primary care physicians relative to population size decreased from 46.6 per 100000 population (95% CI, 0.0-114.6 per 100000 population) to 41.4 per 100000 population (95% CI, 0.0-108.6 per 100000 population), with greater losses in rural areas. In adjusted mixed-effects regressions, every 10 additional primary care physicians per 100000 population was associated with a 51.5-day increase in life expectancy (95% CI, 29.5-73.5 days; 0.2% increase), whereas an increase in 10 specialist physicians per 100000 population corresponded to a 19.2-day increase (95% CI, 7.0-31.3 days). A total of 10 additional primary care physicians per 100000 population was associated with reduced cardiovascular, cancer, and respiratory mortality by 0.9% to 1.4%. Analyses at different geographic levels, using instrumental variable regressions, or at the individual level found similar benefits associated with primary care supply. Conclusions and Relevance: Greater primary care physician supply was associated with lower mortality, but per capita supply decreased between 2005 and 2015. Programs to explicitly direct more resources to primary care physician supply may be important for population health.},

For more information on INFORMS, its publications, membership, or meetings visit Abstract. Many models in operations management involve dynamic decision making that assumes optimal updating in response to information revelation. However, behavioral theory suggests that rather than updating their beliefs, individuals may persevere in their prior beliefs. In particular, we examine how individuals' prior experiences and the experiences of those around them alter their belief perseverance in operational decisions after the revelation of negative news. We draw on an exogenous announcement of negative news by the Food and Drug Administration and explore how it affects interventional car-diologists deciding between two types of cardiac stents. Analyzing 147,000 choices over six years, we find that individuals do respond to negative news by using the focal production tool less often. However, we find that both individuals' own experiences and others' experiences alter their responses. Moreover, although individual and other experience act as substitutes before negative news, we find that this substitution significantly curtails following the negative announcement. Finally, we find that experience leads doctors to discount negative news more rapidly over time. Two lab studies replicate our main findings and show that behavioral biases due to differences in perceptions of expertise drive the effect. Our research contributes not only to operations research but also to the practice of healthcare and operations. History: Accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management.

abstract = {M edical devices play an increasingly significant role in the delivery of health care today. However, persistent quality problems with medical devices and the associated recalls present potential health risks to patients and personnel using these devices. This study addresses three key issues in this regard. First, it empirically assesses the financial implications of medical device recalls to understand if these consequences are severe enough to deter firms from introducing potentially hazardous medical devices into the market, as can be inferred from the literature. Second, the study considers a cross section of medical device manufacturers to examine the effect of firm characteristics on the costs of poor quality. Third, in an attempt to explore the sources of recalls, this study investigates firm characteristics that are likely to be associated with device recalls. The econometric analyses in the study are based on data from manufacturers in the medical device industry over a four-year period (2002-2005). Contrary to our expectations, the findings of the study indicate that at an aggregate level, the market penalties for medical device recalls are not significant, i.e., at the aggregate level, the costs of poor quality are not severe. Furthermore, we find that the magnitude of financial consequences of device recalls is affected by the product scope, sales, growth prospects, and the capital structure of a firm. In our analyses exploring the sources of device recalls, we find that firms with a research and development focus, developing broader product portfolios, have a higher likelihood of device recalls. Also, we find that the likelihood of recalls decreases with prior recall experience, indicating the presence of learning. Implications of the study findings, limitations, and directions for future research are identified.},

@article{Perdikaki2012,
abstract = {A ttracting shoppers to stores and converting the incoming traffic into sales profitably are vital for the financial health of retailers. In this paper, we use proprietary data pertaining to an apparel retailer to study the relationship between store traffic, labor, and sales performance. We decompose sales volume into conversion rate (defined as the ratio of number of transactions to traffic) and basket value (defined as the ratio of sales volume to number of transactions) and analyze the impact of traffic on sales and its components. We find that store sales volume exhibits diminishing returns to scale with respect to traffic, and labor moderates the impact of traffic on sales. For example, we find that for values of traffic and labor corresponding to the mean, increasing average traffic per hour by one unit increases average sales volume per hour by $9.97. Further, we find that the marginal returns to traffic increases from $10.00 to $11.32 when labor increases by one standard deviation. In addition, we find that the conversion rate declines with increasing traffic and a lower conversion rate is associated with a decrease in future traffic growth. Our study underscores the importance of in-store operations in driving the financial performance of retailers.},

@article{Brewer2017,
abstract = {Vaccination is one of the great achievements of the 20th century, yet persistent public-health problems include inadequate, delayed, and unstable vaccination uptake. Psychology offers three general propositions for understanding and intervening to increase uptake where vaccines are available and affordable. The first proposition is that thoughts and feelings can motivate getting vaccinated. Hundreds of studies have shown that risk beliefs and anticipated regret about infectious disease correlate reliably with getting vaccinated; low confidence in vaccine effectiveness and concern about safety correlate reliably with not getting vaccinated. We were surprised to find that few randomized trials have successfully changed what people think and feel about vaccines, and those few that succeeded were minimally effective in increasing uptake. The second proposition is that social processes can motivate getting vaccinated. Substantial research has shown that social norms are associated with vaccination, but few int...},

abstract = {S everal studies have examined how the ISO 9001 quality management systems standard predicts changes in organizational outcomes such as profits. This is the first large-scale study to explore how employee outcomes such as employment, earnings, and health and safety change when employers adopt ISO 9001. We analyzed a matched sample of nearly 1,000 companies in California. ISO 9001 adopters subsequently had far lower organizational death rates than a matched control group of nonadopters. Among surviving employers, ISO adopters had higher growth rates for sales, employment, payroll, and average annual earnings. Injury rates declined slightly for ISO 9001 adopters, although total injury costs did not. These results have implications for organizational theory, managers, and public policy.},

@article{Staats2017,
abstract = {The design and use of standard processes are foundational recommendations in many operations practices. Yet, given the demonstrated performance benefits of standardized processes, it is surprising that they are often not followed consistently. One way to ensure greater compliance is by electronically monitoring the activities of individuals, although such aggressive monitoring poses the risk of inducing backlash. In the setting of hand hygiene in healthcare, a context where compliance with standard processes is frequently less than 50% and where this lack of compliance can result in negative consequences, we investigated the effectiveness of electronic monitoring. We did so using a unique, radio frequency identification (RFID)-based system deployed in 71 hospital units. We found that electronically monitoring individual compliance resulted in a large, positive increase in compliance. We also found that there was substantial variability in the effect across units and that units with higher levels of preactivation compliance experienced increased benefits from monitoring relative to units with lower levels of prepreactivation compliance. By observing compliance rates over three and a half years, we investigated the persistent effects of individual monitoring and found that compliance rates initially increased before they gradually declined. Additionally, in multiple units, individual monitoring was discontinued, allowing for an investigation of the impact of removing the intervention on compliance. Surprisingly, we found that, after removal, compliance rates declined to below prepreactivation levels. Our findings suggest that, although individual electronic monitoring can dramatically improve process compliance, it requires sustained managerial commitment.

@article{Hendricks2005,
abstract = {This paper empirically documents the association between supply chain glitches and operating performance. The results are based on a sample of 885 glitches announced by publicly traded firms. Changes in various operating performance metrics for the sample firms are compared against a sample of control firms of similar size and from similar industries. In the year leading up to the announcement, the control-adjusted mean percent changes in operating income, return on sales, and return on assets for the sample firms are −107%, −114%, and −92%, respectively. During this same period, the control-adjusted changes in the level of return on sales and return on assets are −13.78% and −2.32%, respectively. Relative to controls, firms that experience glitches report on average 6.92% lower sales growth, 10.66% higher growth in cost, and 13.88% higher growth in inventories. More importantly, firms do not quickly recover from the negative economic consequences of glitches. During the two-year time period after the glitch announcement, operating income, sales, total costs, and inventories do not improve. We also find that it does not matter who caused the glitch, what the reason was for the glitch, or what industry a firm belongs to—glitches are associated with negative operating performance across the board.},
