abstract = {The two observations that (1) some low-income citizens demand low redistribution and (2) as income inequality becomes more severe a larger proportion of citizens make less demand for redistribution (Kelly and Enns (2010)) are counter-intuitive because people oppose redistribution that could be beneficial to them. Understanding the main driving factor that leads to the economic conservatism of the poor is crucial: it guides how policymakers should design redistribution. I show that po-sitional concern can be one of these main factors. When citizens care about their relative position on consumption and their labor productivity is slightly perturbed when a new tax policy is implemented, only middle-income citizens may vote for redistribution. Compared with the prospect of upward mobility hypothesis, I provide a testable prediction for the relationship between economic inequality and the economic conservatism of the poor. If positional concern is the main driving factor, policymakers should focus on increasing the low-income citizens' standard of living to the middle class; and if the prospect of upward mobility is the main factor then they should focus on minimizing income gaps.},

abstract = {Health policy xxx (xxxx) xxx a b s t r a c t Best practices in team-based incentive design remain underexplored. This study examines under group-based pay-for-performance, how managers incentivize physicians for teamwork through internal feedback and payment distribution methods. In collaboration with Taiwan Association of Family Medicine, authors conducted a national survey of physician groups, with a response rate of 48.3\%. Multilevel linear regression was applied to 134 groups, collectively consisting of 1,245 physicians in Taiwan. The outcome variables were two manager-rated scores for group performance on achieving (a) comprehensive, coordinated , continuous care, and (b) patient health improvement. The results indicate that providing each physician feedback on peer performance is superior to not providing it; when providing peer information within a group, concealing identities is superior to revealing them. These findings imply that application of the principle of social comparison can be effective; however, caution should be taken when disclosure of identifiable peer performance may intensify peer competition and undermine care coordination in team-based models. Further, groups that distribute payments equally among physicians perform better than groups that distributed payment proportionally to physicians' patient shares. The findings are ger-mane to small teams, where physicians do not have full control over care processes and outcomes, and need to work cooperatively to maximize group-based payment.},

INFORMS provides unique networking and learning opportunities for individual professionals, and organizations of all types and sizes, to better understand and use O.R. and analytics tools and methods to transform strategic visions and achieve better outcomes. For more information on INFORMS, its publications, membership, or meetings visit Abstract. Frequently, policy makers seek to roll out an intervention previously proven effective in a research study, perhaps subject to resource constraints. However, because different subpopulations may respond differently to the same treatment, there is no a priori guarantee that the intervention will be as effective in the targeted population as it was in the study. How then should policy makers target individuals to maximize intervention effectiveness? We propose a novel robust optimization approach that leverages evidence typically available in a published study. Our model can be easily optimized in minutes for realistic instances with off-the-shelf software and is flexible enough to accommodate a variety of resource and fairness constraints. We compare our approach with current practice by proving performance guarantees for both approaches, which emphasize their structural differences. We also prove an intuitive interpretation of our model in terms of regularization, penalizing differences in the demographic distribution between targeted individuals and the study population. Although the precise penalty depends on the choice of uncertainty set, we show that for special cases we can recover classical penalties from the covariate matching literature on causal inference. Finally, using real data from a large teaching hospital, we compare our approach to common practice in the particular context of reducing emergency department utilization by Medicaid patients through case management. We find that our approach can offer significant benefits over common practice, particularly when the heterogeneity in patient response to the treatment is large.

abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of identifying network effects in contagion processes and present an application to the propagation of influenza in the United States. In particular, using data on the evolution of infections over time, the travel intensity between states as well as environmental conditions we first provide a framework to identify the true network effect of traveling between states. Any identification strategy in this context needs to handle the following challenges: the reflection problem and the time correlation problem. The reflection problem arises from the observation that when sampling from the contagion process is frequent (in our case, weekly), the (potential) endogenous network effect cannot be discriminated from the correlation effect (such as that due to similar environmental conditions). The time-correlation effect stems from the observation that contagion processes are naturally characterized by correlation across different lags. We propose an instrumental variable approach, based on a spatiotemporally lagged versions of the observed data, and we show that our approach effectively tackles the aforementioned issues both theoretically and through a series of robustness checks. Finally, we use our estimates to propose and evaluate the performance of intervention and control policies, illustrating the benefits of network-based interventions.},

Working with observational data poses an important econometric challenge: as mentioned above, realized patient flow is endogenous to the congestion level in the hospital. To address the endogeneity issue, we use the instrumental variable approach where we construct instruments by exploiting the variation in the network structure (Bramoulle et al. 2009, Drakopoulos and Zheng 2017). Using counterfactual analyses, we show how our estimation results can be used to identify the bottleneck unit—the unit that has the biggest impact on system performance when its utilization is changed—and draw insights on how unit characteristics can help identify the bottleneck unit.},

However, causal inference poses many challenges in DID designs. In this article, we review key features of DID designs with an emphasis on public health policy research. Contemporary researchers should take an active approach to the design of DID studies, seeking to construct comparison groups, sensitivity analyses, and robustness checks that help validate the method's assumptions. We explain the key assumptions of the design and discuss analytic tactics, supplementary analysis, and approaches to statistical inference that are often important in applied research. The DID design is not a perfect substitute for randomized experiments, but it often represents a feasible way to learn about casual relationships. We conclude by noting that combining elements from multiple quasi-experimental techniques may be important in the next wave of innovations to the DID approach.},

However, when leaders assign tasks to team members, performance is usually not the only consideration. Favouritism, employees' seniority, employees' preferences over tasks, and fairness considerations often play a role as well. Team incentives have the potential to curtail the role of these factors in favor of performance — in particular when the incentive plan includes both the leader and the team members. This paper presents the results of a field experiment designed to study the effects of such team incentives on task assignment and performance. We introduce team incentives in a random subsets of 108 stores of a Dutch retail chain. We find no effect of the incentive, neither on task assignment nor on performance.},

abstract = {Matching estimators for average treatment effects are widely used in evaluation research despite the fact that their large sample properties have not been established in many cases. The absence of formal results in this area may be partly due to the fact that standard asymptotic expansions do not apply to matching estimators with a fixed number of matches because such estimators are highly nonsmooth functionals of the data. In this article we develop new methods for analyzing the large sample properties of matching estimators and establish a number of new results. We focus on matching with replacement with a fixed number of matches. First, we show that matching estimators are not N1/2-consistent in general and describe conditions under which matching estimators do attain N1/2-consistency. Second, we show that even in settings where matching estimators are N1/2-consistent, simple matching estimators with a fixed number of matches do not attain the semiparametric efficiency bound. Third, we provide a consistent estimator for the large sample variance that does not require consistent nonparametric estimation of unknown functions. Software for implementing these methods is available in Matlab, Stata, and R.},

abstract = {Propensity score matching (PSM) has become a popular approach to estimate causal treatment effects. It is widely applied when evaluating labour market policies, but empirical examples can be found in very diverse fields of study. Once the researcher has decided to use PSM, he is confronted with a lot of questions regarding its implementation. To begin with, a first decision has to be made concerning the estimation of the propensity score. Following that one has to decide which matching algorithm to choose and determine the region of common support. Subsequently, the matching quality has to be assessed and treatment effects and their standard errors have to be estimated. Furthermore, questions like 'what to do if there is choice-based sampling?' or 'when to measure effects?' can be important in empirical studies. Finally, one might also want to test the sensitivity of estimated treatment effects with respect to unobserved heterogeneity or failure of the common support condition. Each implementation step involves a lot of decisions and different approaches can be thought of. The aim of this paper is to discuss these implementation issues and give some guidance to researchers who want to use PSM for evaluation purposes. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are increasingly popular in the social sciences, not only in medicine. We argue that the lay public, and sometimes researchers, put too much trust in RCTs over other methods of investigation. Contrary to frequent claims in the applied literature, randomization does not equalize everything other than the treatment in the treatment and control groups, it does not automatically deliver a precise estimate of the average treatment effect (ATE), and it does not relieve us of the need to think about (observed or un-observed) covariates. Finding out whether an estimate was generated by chance is more difficult than commonly believed. At best, an RCT yields an unbiased estimate, but this property is of limited practical value. Even then, estimates apply only to the sample selected for the trial, often no more than a convenience sample, and justification is required to extend the results to other groups, including any population to which the trial sample belongs, or to any individual, including an individual in the trial. Demanding 'external validity' is unhelpful because it expects too much of an RCT while undervaluing its potential contribution. RCTs do indeed require minimal assumptions and can operate with little prior knowledge. This is an advantage when persuading dis-trustful audiences, but it is a disadvantage for cumulative scientific progress, where prior knowledge should be built upon, not discarded. RCTs can play a role in building scientific knowledge and useful predictions but they can only do so as part of a cumulative program, combining with other methods, including conceptual and theoretical development, to discover not 'what works', but 'why things work'.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine whether education, feedback, and provider prompts decrease the rate of missed vaccine opportunities; and the reasons for missed opportunities in the post-intervention group. A nonrandomized, before and after study to evaluate the effect of education, feedback, and provider prompts on missed opportunities was conducted in an inner-city community health center with a predominantly hispanic population. Vaccine opportunities were defined as visits of children 36 months or younger who were vaccination-eligible by ACIP guidelines. Consecutive sampling was used to identify two groups of children with vaccine opportunities: pre-and post-intervention. Feedback was given to vaccine providers on the frequency of missed opportunities in the pre-intervention group. The ACIP recommended vaccine schedule and true vaccine contraindications were reviewed. Nursing personnel were taught to identify and tag charts of children with vaccine opportunities. Physicians were asked to record vaccination status and the reason any vaccination was deferred. Missed opportunities decreased significantly, from 49\% (173/352) to 13\% (45/344), after the interventions (p < 0.001). The reasons for the 45 missed opportunities in the post-intervention sample were parent refusal (15.6\%), moderate or severe illness (15.6\%), and incorrect documentation as "up-to-date" (13.3\%). In 28.9\% there was a missed opportunity for simultaneous immunization. No reasons were documented for the remaining missed opportunity visits (26.6\%). The interventions, which emphasized improving provider knowledge of vaccinations and screening vaccine status at each visit, effectively decreased missed opportunities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Standing order programs (SOPs) allowing nonphysician personnel to assess patients' immunization status and administer vaccines without an individual physician order are a proven method of increasing adult vaccinations, yet they are underutilized by primary care physicians. METHODS: In a before-and-after trial, a pilot-tested and revised SOP toolkit (4 Pillars Toolkit) was implemented in four diverse primary care practices. Changes in influenza and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) vaccination rates were measured. The toolkit was evaluated using direct observation, group interviews, and surveys of each practice's staff. RESULTS: Use of the 4 Pillars Toolkit varied across sites. PPSV rates increased significantly overall for high-risk adults (18-64 years; 25\% in 2010-2011 vs. 40\% in 2011-2012, p = .02) but not for older adults (≥65 years; 44\% vs. 52\%, p = .26) and in two of four practices among both high-risk and older adults (p < .05). Influenza vaccination rates increased significantly in three of four sites and overall (22\% in 2010-2011 vs. 33\% in 2011-2012, overall; p < .001). Practices more fully implementing the toolkit demonstrated larger increases in vaccination rates. CONCLUSIONS: The 4 Pillars Toolkit is a promising means of improving primary care practice across diverse settings, with better results observed when strategies were maximally utilized.},

Study Design: Post hoc analysis of data from a randomized controlled cluster trial. Methods: Eighteen primary care practices received staff education, guidance for using the 4 Pillars™ Program and support of a practice immunization champion. Paired t-tests were used to compare vaccination rates were compared separately for those with diabetes, chronic lung or chronic heart disease or other high-risk conditions. Student's t-tests were used to compare across high-risk conditions. Generalized estimating equation modeling was used to determine likelihood of vaccination. Results: Based on ICD9 codes, 4,737 patients 18-64 years old were identified as having diabetes (n=1,999), chronic heart disease (n=658), chronic lung disease (n=1,682) or another high-risk condition (n=764). PPSV vaccination increased 12.2 percentage points (PP), Tdap vaccination increased 11.4 PP and influenza vaccination increased 4.8 PP. In regression analyses, patients with diabetes (OR=2.2, 95\%CI=1.80-2.73), chronic lung disease (OR=1.50, 95\% CI=1.21-1.87) or chronic heart disease (OR=1.32, 95\% CI=1.02-1.71) were more likely to receive PPSV than those without the respective high-risk condition. Those with diabetes (OR=1.14, 95\% CI=1.01-1.28) or chronic lung disease (OR=1.14, 95\% CI=1.01-1.30) were more likely to receive influenza vaccination than those without the respective condition.; likelihood of Tdap vaccination was not significantly associated with any of the chronic conditions tested. Conclusions: An intervention including the 4 Pillars™ Program was associated with significant increases in vaccination of high-risk adults. Overall uptake of recommended vaccines for those with high-risk conditions remained below national goals.},

abstract = {Purpose-To increase childhood influenza vaccination rates using a toolkit and early vaccine delivery in a randomized cluster trial. Methods-Twenty primary care practices treating children (range for n=536-8,183) were randomly assigned to Intervention and Control arms to test the effectiveness of an evidence-based practice improvement toolkit (4 Pillars Toolkit) and early vaccine supplies for use among disadvantaged children on influenza vaccination rates among children 6 months-18 years. Follow-up staff meetings and surveys were used to assess use and acceptability of the intervention strategies in the Intervention arm. Rates for the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 influenza seasons were compared. Two-level generalized linear mixed modeling was used to evaluate outcomes. Results-Overall increases in influenza vaccination rates were significantly greater in the Intervention arm (7.9 percentage points) compared with the Control arm (4.4 percentage points; P<0.034). These rate changes represent 4522 additional doses in the Intervention arm vs. 1,390 additional doses in the Control arm. This effect of the intervention was observed despite the fact that rates increased significantly in both arms-8/10 Intervention (P<0.001) and 7/10 Control sites (P-values 0.04 to <0.001). Rates in two Intervention sites with pre-intervention vaccination rates >58\% did not significantly increase. In regression analyses, a child's likelihood of being vaccinated was significantly higher with: younger age, white race (Odds ratio [OR]=1.29; 95\% confidence interval [CI]=1.23-1.34), having commercial insurance (OR=1.30; 95\%CI=1.25-1.35), higher pre-intervention practice vaccination rate (OR=1.25; 95\%CI=1.16-1.34), and being in the Intervention arm (OR=1.23; 95\%CI=1.01-1.50). Early delivery of influenza vaccine was rated by Intervention practices as an effective strategy for raising rates. Conclusions-Implementation of a multi-strategy toolkit and early vaccine supplies can significantly improve influenza vaccination rates among children in primary care practices but the effect may be less pronounced in practices with moderate to high existing vaccination rates.},

abstract = {Background: Although provider feedback and recall/reminder systems have been shown to increase vaccination rates for children, little is known about the effectiveness of less intensive interventions. Objective: To determine whether provider prompting at acute care visits in an urban hospital-based outpatient clinic can increase vaccination rates and decrease missed opportunities. Design and Methods: Study participants, 3 years or younger, were identified from a managed care organization as receiving primary care at the clinic. Eligibility criteria included 1 or more visits to the clinic without regard to continuity of enrollment. Patients vaccination records were generated at nursing triage and attached to the encounter sheet. Vaccination and visit data were abstracted from medical records, and comparisons were made between baseline (n=521) and postintervention (n=642) groups for up-to-date vaccination rates, missed opportunity rates, and mean numbers of visits. Results: Up-to-date rates at the age of 24 months for 4 diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis, 3 polio, 1 measles-mumps-rubella, 3 hepatitis B, and 3 Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines changed from 70\% to 78\% (P=.07). Up-to-date rates increased significantly to 87\% among the subset of children continuously enrolled in the managed care organization and the practice (P<.01). Overall, mean numbers of visits were similar. Missed opportunity rates among children not up-to-date for 4 diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis, 3 polio, 1 measles-mumps-rubella, 3 hepatitis B, and 3 Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines at the age of 24 months declined from 65\% to 45\% (P=.04). Similar trends were noted at the age of 10 months. Conclusions: In the absence of increased funding, minor changes in standard operating procedures may improve vaccination delivery. Further improvements may require efforts to ensure continuity of provider and plan assignment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: At child health visits, immunizations that are due are frequently not given. Increased parent understanding of and demand for immunizations may influence providers to not miss these opportunities. OBJECTIVE: To assess, as part of a larger study of effectiveness of parent education and case management (CM) in raising immunization rates, the intervention's effectiveness at reducing missed opportunities to vaccinate during child health visits. METHODS: A representative sample of African American newborns and their families from south central Los Angeles, Calif, were randomly assigned to a control or a CM group and observed during the first year of life. Case managers visited and telephoned parents, educating them on the benefits and safety of immunizations, and encouraging them to request immunizations from providers. When the children were at least 1 year of age, parents were interviewed and provider records were abstracted. RESULTS: Complete records were abstracted for 126 controls and 129 CM group children. For these children, 1092 visits were documented where immunizations were due. Missed opportunities to vaccinate occurred at more than 50\% of visits. Case management was associated with a modest reduction in the percentage of visits with missed opportunities in the bivariate analysis but not after adjustment for other covariates. In a logistic regression model, missed opportunities were more frequent at visits with private than public physicians and at acute illness than well-child visits. Missed opportunities were less frequent among children with a history of at least 1 cancelled appointment, and for visits of children with mothers who smoked. CONCLUSIONS: Missed opportunities were minimally influenced by a home visitation and parent education program. They are primarily determined by issues under the control of the provider. Family- and child-related characteristics, however, do influence the likelihood of a missed opportunity occurring independent of provider factors.},

Nine primary care sites serving impoverished and middle-class children. Subjects. Complete birth cohorts (ages 0 to 12 months; n 3015) from these sites. Interventions. Two 18-month duration interventions: 1) tracking with outreach [tracking/outreach] to bring underimmunized children to their primary care provider office, and 2) a primary care provider office policy change to identify and reduce missed immunization opportunities (prompting). Design. Randomized, controlled trial, randomizing within sites using a two-by-two factorial design. Subjects were allocated to one of four study groups: control, prompting only, tracking/outreach only, and combined prompting with tracking/outreach. Outcomes were obtained by blinded chart abstraction. Measures. Immunization status for age; number of days of delay in immunization; primary care utilization; and rates of screening for occult disease. Results. Out of 3015 subjects, 274 subjects (9\%) transferred out of the participating sites or had incomplete charts and were excluded. The 2741 (91\%) remaining subjects were assessed. At baseline, study groups did not differ in age, gender, insurance type, or immunization status. Of the remaining subjects, 63\% received Medic-aid.

Analysis of variance showed that: 1) tracking/outreach increased immunization rates 20 percentage points; 2) tracking/outreach decreased mean immunization delay 63 days; 3) tracking/outreach increased mean health supervision visits 0.44 visits per child; 4) tracking/outreach increased mean anemia screening 0.17 screenings per child and mean lead screenings 0.12 screenings per child; 5) impact of tracking/outreach was greatest for uninsured and impoverished patients; and 6) the prompting intervention had no impact on the studied outcomes, and its failure was caused by inconsistent use of prompts and failure to vaccinate ill children when prompted. Using tracking/outreach, the cost per additional child fully immunized was 474. Each 1000 spent on the track-ing/outreach intervention resulted in: 2.1 additional fully vaccinated children and 668 fewer child-days of delayed immunization; 4.6 additional health supervision visits and 5.9 additional other visits to the primary care provider ; and 1.8 additional anemia screenings and 1.3 additional lead screenings. Conclusions. Outreach directed toward children not up-to-date on immunizations improves not only immunization status, but also health supervision visit attendance and screening rates. The cost per additional child immunized was high, but should be interpreted in view of the spillover benefits that accompanied improved immunization. Effective means to improve coverage by reducing missed immunization opportunities still need to be identified.

abstract = {Background: Missed opportunities for vaccination (MOVs) occur when persons eligible for vaccination visit a health facility and do not get the vaccines they need. We conducted a systematic review to assess effects of interventions for reducing MOVs. Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in April 2017. Three authors independently screened search outputs, reviewed potentially eligible papers, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data; resolving disagreements by consensus. We expressed study results as risk ratios (RR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool. Results: Six studies (five trials and one cohort study) met our inclusion criteria, all conducted in the United States of America. All six studies had various limitations and were classified as having a high risk of bias. We found moderate certainty evidence that the following interventions probably improve vaccination coverage: patient education (RR 1.92, 95\% CI 1.38-2.68), patient tracking using community health workers (RR 1.18, 95\% CI 1.11-1.25), and patient tracking and provider prompts (RR 1.24, 95\% CI 1.18-1.31). In addition, we found low certainty evidence that concurrent interventions targeting health-facility (education, prompts, and audit and feedback) and family settings (phone calls) may increase vaccination coverage (RR 1.25, 95\% CI 1.08-1.46). Conclusions: The currently available evidence suggests that patient education, patient tracking, outreach sessions, and provider prompts reduce missed opportunities for vaccination and improve vaccination coverage. Rigorous studies are required to confirm these findings and increase the certainty of the current evidence base. WHO is currently coordinating efforts to generate such evidence, especially from low-income and middle-income countries, and it is likely that the data will be available in the next few years.},

abstract = {Many psychological theories predict U-shaped relationships: The effect of x is positive for low values of x, but negative for high values, or vice versa. Despite implying merely a change of sign, hypotheses about U-shaped functions are tested almost exclusively via quadratic regressions, an approach that imposes an arbitrary functional-form assumption that in some scenarios can lead to a 100\% rate of false positives (e.g., the incorrect conclusion that y = log( x) is U shaped). Estimating two regression lines, one for low and one for high values of x, allows testing for a sign change without a functional-form assumption. I introduce the Robin Hood algorithm as a way to set the break point between the lines. This algorithm delivers higher power to detect U shapes than all the other break-point-setting alternatives I compared with it. The article includes simulations demonstrating the performance of the two-lines test and reanalyses of published results using this test.

abstract = {We present evidence from a firm level experiment in which we engineered an exogenous change in managerial compensation from fixed wages to performance pay based on the average productivity of lower-tier workers. Theory suggests that managerial incentives affect both the mean and dispersion of workers' productivity through two channels. First, managers respond to incentives by targeting their efforts towards more able workers, implying that both the mean and the dispersion increase. Second, managers select out the least able workers, implying that the mean increases but the dispersion may decrease. In our field experiment we find that the introduction of managerial performance pay raises both the mean and dispersion of worker productivity. Analysis of individual level productivity data shows that managers target their effort towards high ability workers, and the least able workers are less likely to be selected into employment. These results highlight the interplay between the provision of managerial incentives and earnings inequality among lower-tier workers.},

abstract = {Background: Current multivalent influenza vaccine products provide protection against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B lineage viruses. The 2018–2019 influenza season in the US included prolonged circulation of both A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses well-matched to the vaccine strain, and A(H3N2) viruses the majority of which were mismatched to the vaccine. We estimate the number of vaccineprevented influenza-associated illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths for the season. Methods: We used a mathematical model and Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate numbers and 95\% uncertainty intervals (UI) of influenza-associated outcomes prevented by vaccination in the US. The model incorporated age-specific estimates of national 2018–2019 influenza vaccine coverage, influenza virus-specific vaccine effectiveness from the US Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network, and disease burden estimated from population-based rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network. Results: Influenza vaccination prevented an estimated 4.4 million (95\% UI: 3.4 million–7.1 million) illnesses, 2.3 million (95\% UI: 1.8 million–3.8 million) medical visits, 58,000 (95\% UI: 30,000–156,000) hospitalizations, and 3,500 (95\% UI: 1,000–13,000) deaths due to influenza viruses during the US 2018– 2019 influenza season. Vaccination prevented 14\% of projected hospitalizations associated with A(H1N1)pdm09 overall and 43\% among young children aged 6 months–4 years. Conclusions: Influenza vaccination averted substantial influenza-associated disease including hospitalizations and deaths in the US, primarily due to effectiveness against A(H1N1)pdm09. Our findings underscore the value of influenza vaccination, highlighting that vaccines measurably decrease illness and associated health care utilization even in a season in which a vaccine component does not match to a circulating virus.},

Furthermore, great strategies focus attention on creating value for the customer—through the firm's value proposition and business model—relative to capturing value for the shareholders. Finally, we propose that great strategies emerge from a focused, strategic agenda communicated and distributed throughout the organization. We illustrate our propositions by compar- ing Apple and Motorola, which began with similar ideas for developing a strategy for seamless integration and seamless mobility, with smartphones as the digital hub.

We sought to determine the amount of time required for a primary care physician to provide recommended preventive services to an average patient panel. Methods. We used published and estimated times per service to determine the physician time required to provide all services recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), at the recommended frequency, to a patient panel of 2500 with an age and sex distribution similar to that of the US population. Results. To fully satisfy the USPSTF recommendations, 1773 hours of a physician's annual time, or 7.4 hours per working day, is needed for the provision of preventive services. Conclusions. Time constraints limit the ability of physicians to comply with preventive services recommendations. (Am J Public Health. 2003;93:635-641) national agencies (e.g., the American Cancer Society) have created their own guidelines, increasing the number of screening tests to be considered. Given competing financial demands to see a greater number of patients while providing increasing levels of preventive services, it is worth examining whether providing the recommended preventive services for the patients in a practice can be reasonably accomplished. Delivery of preventive services obviously consumes physician time, but no study has estimated how much time is required to provide each service or, more importantly, the time needed to deliver these services to all patients in a practice. In this study we examined the following questions: To fully achieve current recommendations for the provision of preventive services, how much time would be required for a practicing physician to provide the recommended services to all patients? What percentage of the physician's available work hours would need to be spent delivering these services? METHODS To calculate the total time necessary to provide preventive services to a population, we considered 4 elements: (1) a list of recommended services, (2) the frequency of performing each service, (3) the number of people requiring each service, and (4) the time required to administer each service. The product of these 4 factors was compared with},

Physician time constraints in primary care are likely one cause. METHODS We applied guideline recommendations for 10 common chronic diseases to a panel of 2,500 primary care patients with an age-sex distribution and chronic disease prevalences similar to those of the general population, and estimated the minimum physician time required to deliver high-quality care for these conditions. The result was compared with time available for patient care for the average primary care physician. RESULTS Eight hundred twenty-eight hours per year, or 3.5 hours a day, were required to provide care for the top 10 chronic diseases, provided the disease is stable and in good control. We recalculated this estimate based on increased time requirements for uncontrolled disease. Estimated time required increased by a factor of 3. Applying this factor to all 10 diseases, time demands increased to 2,484 hours, or 10.6 hours a day. CONCLUSIONS Current practice guidelines for only 10 chronic illnesses require more time than primary care physicians have available for patient care overall. Streamlined guidelines and alternative methods of service delivery are needed to meet recommended standards for quality health care.},

This paper disentangles the effects of demotivation, social conformity, and status associated with ranking. I implement a randomized experiment at a Bangladeshi sweater factory that pays employees on piece rates. Treated workers receive monthly information on their relative performance either in private or in public. A simple theoretical framework shows that intrinsic status concerns induce Private Treatment workers to increase or decrease effort depending on the feedback they receive from the intervention. Workers in Public Treatment respond similarly but face two additional incentives-social status (positive effect) and social conformity (negative effect). Empirical evidence shows that Private Treatment workers increased (decreased) effort upon receiving positive (negative) feedback. Public ranking led to lower net effort relative to Private Treatment because of a strong preference not to outperform friends. The negative effects from demo-tivation and social conformity may explain why the existing literature finds mixed evidence of impact of ranking workers.},

A large US transportation company is in the process of {\ldots}tting its trucks with an electronic on-board recorder (EOBR), which provide drivers with information on their driving performance. In this setting, a natural question is whether the optimal managerial practice consists of: (1) Letting each driver know his or her individual performance only; or (2) Also providing drivers with information about their ranking with respect to other drivers. The company is also in the {\ldots}rst phase of a multi-year 'lean-management journey', which corresponds to an overhaul of the relational contract with its employees. This phase focuses exclusively on changing employee values, mainly toward a greater emphasis on teamwork and empowerment. The main result of our randomized experiment is that (2) leads to better performance than (1) in a particular site if and only if the site has not yet received the values intervention, and worse performance if it has. The result is consistent with the presence of a con ‡ict between competition-based managerial practices and a cooperation-based relational contract. More broadly, it highlights the role of intangible relational factors in We are particularly indebted to Rebecca Henderson who has provided extensive support and advice during this ongoing research program and of course to our partner company for their collaboration.

This paper studies the effect of providing feedback to college students on their position in the grade distribution by using a natural field experiment. This information was updated every six months during a three-year period. We find that greater grades transparency decreases educational performance, as measured by the number of examinations passed and grade point average (GPA). However, self-reported satisfaction, as measured by surveys conducted after feedback is provided but before students take their examinations, increases. We provide a theoretical framework to understand these results, focusing on the role of prior beliefs and using out-of-trial surveys to test the model. In the absence of treatment, a majority of students underestimate their position in the grade distribution, suggesting that the updated information is "good news" for many students. Moreover, the negative effect on performance is driven by those students who underestimate their position in the absence of feedback. Students who overestimate initially their position, if anything, respond positively. The performance effects are short lived-by the time students graduate, they have similar accumulated GPA and graduation rates.},

Our results show that the average performance of the subjects who are provided self-performance feedback is 11\% lower than the ones who obtain no feedback. Moreover, setting a non-binding personal goal does not affect performance. Finally, assigning an exogenous goal and providing relative performance feedback decreases performance by 8\%.

We found 90\% or greater agreement on the importance of 32 (58\%) statements. These statements, indicating issues considered to be of considerable importance (rated as important or very important), related to: computerised alerts; the need to avoid spurious alerts; making it difficult to override critical alerts; having audit trails of such overrides; support for safe repeat prescribing, effective computer-user interface; importance of call and recall management; and the need to be able to run safety reports.

abstract = {Many computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems have integrated drug safety alerts. The authors reviewed the literature on physician response to drug safety alerts and interpreted the results using Reason's framework of accident causation. In total, 17 papers met the inclusion criteria. Drug safety alerts are overridden by clinicians in 49\% to 96\% of cases. Alert overriding may often be justified and adverse drug events due to overridden alerts are not always preventable. A distinction between appropriate and useful alerts should be made. The alerting system may contain error-producing conditions like low specificity, low sensitivity, unclear information content, unnecessary workflow disruptions, and unsafe and inefficient handling. These may result in active failures of the physician, like ignoring alerts, misinterpretation, and incorrect handling. Efforts to improve patient safety by increasing correct handling of drug safety alerts should focus on the error-producing conditions in software and organization. Studies on cognitive processes playing a role in overriding drug safety alerts are lacking. j J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2006;13:138-147. DOI 10.1197/jamia.M1809. Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems frequently include integrated decision support components, which can reduce errors and improve patient safety. 1-6 Studies documenting positive effects of decision support on patient outcomes, including fewer duplicate orders, fewer overdoses, fewer allergic reactions, and reduced drug interactions , have prompted calls for additional safety-related, patient-specific advice. 1,3,5 Yet, the burden of reminders and alerts must not be too high, 1,2,6-8 or ''alert fatigue'' may cause clinicians to override both important and unimportant alerts, 2,9 in a manner that compromises the desired safety effect of integrating decision support into CPOE. This review attempts to provide insight into physicians' handling of safety alerts by asking the following questions: How often and in what situations are safety alerts overridden? Why do physicians override them? What effects ensue? What understanding of alert overrides can lead to improved alerting systems? The authors employ Reason's model of accident causation 10 to understand overriding and its effects and to suggest new directions to improve alerting. Methods The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from January 1980 to December 2004 were searched for English-language publications with the following MeSH headings and text words: computerized physician (medication) order entry, CPOE, electronic prescribing, computerized prescribing, medical record systems computerized and alert *, remind *, prompt *, order check, critic*, critiq*, decision support systems clinical, reminder systems, drug therapy computer assisted and over-rid *, medical error, adverse drug events, and attitude. The authors also checked literature references of three recent systematic reviews and one synthesis of review paper. 1,3,5,11 The authors selected publications discussing overriding of unsolicited drug safety alerts that appear during the prescription process because automatic provision of alerts has been proven to be a critical feature for changing clinician behavior. 12 The term computerized physician order entry is used because interpretation and handling of drug safety alerts requires medical expertise. Full articles were included, but also proceedings when pertinent. The references of these publications were checked also. The refined selection was used for the first part of this review. To learn how alerting could be improved, the authors examined all publications from the search for characteristics of unsolicited safety alerts as well as measures to minimize error-producing conditions. Results Seventeen publications on overriding safety alerts in CPOE were identified 2,13-28 (Table 1). Quantitative information on overriding was present in nine publications. 13-21 This small yield does not pose a problem because the review focuses mainly on the conceptual analysis of the determinants of overriding. For the second part of this article, we selected from 193 papers of the first search those that described characteristics of safety alerts.},

In this study, we develop a sample of US hospitals and use cardiac care as our context to empirically examine our questions. To measure a patient's resource usage, we use the total length of stay, which includes any additional inpatient stay necessitated by unplanned readmissions within thirty days after initial hospitalization. We find evidence that higher process quality, and more specifically its clinical (as opposed to its administrative) dimensions, are associated with a reduction in resource usage. Moreover, the standardization of care that is achieved via the implementation of medical guidelines, makes this effect more pronounced in less focused environments: higher process quality is more beneficial when the cardiac department's patient population is distributed across a wider range of medical conditions. We explore the implications of these findings for process-oriented pay-for-performance programs, which tie the reimbursement of hospitals to their adherence to evidence-based medical guidelines.},

Anecdotal evidence suggests that firms can achieve internal benefits such as quality or productivity improvements or that certification can help firms maintain or increase their market share, or both. Others argue that the standard is too generic to cause performance improvement but can be seen as a signal of good management. In this paper, we track financial performance from 1987 to 1997 of all publicly traded ISO 9000 certified manufacturing firms in the United States with SIC codes 2000-3999, and test whether ISO 9000 certification leads to productivity improvements, market benefits, and improved financial performance. We employ event-study methods, matching each certified firm to a control group of one or more noncertified firms in the same industry with similar precertification size and/or return on assets. We find that firms' decision to seek their first ISO 9000 certification was indeed followed by significant abnormal improvements in financial performance, though the exact timing and magnitude of this effect depend on the specification of the control group. Three years after certification, the certified firms do display strongly significant abnormal performance under all control-group specifications. The degree to which the precise results vary across control-group specifications indicates that event studies should always include extensive sensitivity analysis, for instance matching by size and performance separately and jointly, using both single firms and portfolios as controls.},

For more information on INFORMS, its publications, membership, or meetings visit T o investigate the opportunity for hospitals to achieve better care at lower cost, we examine two key process quality measures, conformance quality and experiential quality, and two measures of performance, readmis-sion rate and cost per discharge. Conformance quality represents a hospital's level of adherence to evidence-based standards of care, whereas experiential quality represents the level of interaction between hospital's caregivers and patients. Analyzing six years of data from 3,474 U.S. acute care hospitals, we find that combining conformance and experiential quality results in lower readmission rates. However, conformance quality and experiential quality each independently increase cost per discharge, which suggests that a readmissions-costs trade-off is unavoidable. To investigate this further, we conduct post hoc analyses by distinguishing between the granular elements of experiential quality (EQ) based on task type: response-focused EQ and communication-focused EQ. Response-focused EQ measures caregivers' ability to respond to patient's explicit needs, whereas communication-focused EQ measures caregivers' ability to engage in meaningful conversations with the patient. We find that combining communication-focused EQ with conformance quality reduces readmission rates. Moreover , as conformance quality increases, the cost of improving communication-focused EQ decreases, indicating complementarity. Response-focused EQ in combination with conformance quality also results in reduced read-mission rates. However, as conformance quality increases, the cost of improving response-focused EQ also increases, suggesting that these dimensions might compete for resources. Taken together, our results suggest that hospital administrators can mitigate the trade-off between reducing readmissions and controlling costs by prioritizing communication-focused EQ over response-focused EQ.},

abstract = {WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that health departments in all 50 states deliver AFIX (Assessment, Feedback, Incentives, and eXchange) consultations to 25\% of federally funded vaccine providers each year. AFIX effectively raises vaccination coverage among young children. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: AFIX consultations achieved short-term gains in coverage for 11-to 12-year-olds for vaccines in the adolescent platform. No gains occurred for older adolescents or over the long term. Consultations were equally effective when delivered in-person or by webinar. abstract OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of in-person and webinar-delivered AFIX (Assessment, Feedback, Incentives, and eXchange) consultations for increasing adolescent vaccine coverage. METHODS: We randomly assigned 91 primary care clinics in North Carolina, serving 107 443 adolescents, to receive no consultation or an in-person or webinar AFIX consultation. We delivered in-person consultations in April through May 2011 and webinar consultations in May through August 2011. The state' s immunization registry provided vaccine coverage data for younger patients (ages 11-12 years) and older patients (ages 13-18 years) for 3 adolescent vaccines: tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap); meningo-coccal; and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines (1 dose, females only). RESULTS: At the 5-month follow-up, AFIX consultations increased vaccine coverage among younger adolescents. Patients in the in-person arm experienced coverage changes that exceeded those in the control arm for Tdap (3.4\% [95\% confidence interval (CI): 2.2 to 4.6]), menin-gococcal (4.7\% [95\% CI: 2.3 to 7.2], and HPV (1.5\% [95\% CI: 0.3 to 2.7]) vaccines. Patients in the webinar versus control arm also experienced larger changes for these vaccines. AFIX did little to improve coverage among older adolescents. At 1 year, the 3 arms showed similar coverage changes. The effectiveness of in-person and webinar consultations was not statistically different at either time point (all, P ..05). CONCLUSIONS: Webinar AFIX consultations were as effective as in-person consultations in achieving short-term increases in vaccine coverage for younger adolescents. AFIX consultations for adolescents need improvement to have a stronger and more durable impact, especially for HPV vaccine.},

abstract = {We study the role of process friction in increasing efficiency of service provisions. We examine one potential lever for reducing the provision of discretionary services: "justification"-an otherwise non-value-added process step that introduces process friction by forcing workers to explain the rationale for requesting an optional service. We exploit the presence-and absence-of a justification step in the ultrasound (US) ordering process at two emergency departments (EDs). We find that patients with abdominal pain are less than half as likely to receive an US when there is a justification step compared to when there is not. Additionally, we find a spillover effect: other diagnostic tests are also ordered less frequently. The decrease in testing reduces the average length of stay of the patients, and reduces testing costs by more than 200,000, with no decrease in quality. We show that two mechanisms underlie these results: 1) justification reduces clinicians' available time, and 2) justification forces clinicians to reflect on a patient's need for service. Our paper contributes to recent theory on friction and reflection as drivers of efficiency in services. We show that justification can serve as an effective lever for reducing medical tests-and costs-without negatively impacting quality.},

EHR-based alerts have proved effective in improving vaccine delivery for routine pediatric vaccines but have not been thoroughly examined for influenza vaccine. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study is the first trial of EHR-based clinical alerts to improve influenza vaccine delivery in pediatric primary care. abstract OBJECTIVE: The goal was to assess the impact of influenza vaccine clinical alerts on missed opportunities for vaccination and on overall influenza immunization rates for children and adolescents with asthma. METHODS: A prospective, cluster-randomized trial of 20 primary care sites was conducted between October 1, 2006, and March 31, 2007. At intervention sites, electronic health record-based clinical alerts for influenza vaccine appeared at all office visits for children between 5 and 19 years of age with asthma who were due for vaccine. The proportion of captured immunization opportunities at visits and overall rates of complete vaccination for patients at intervention and control sites were compared with those for the previous year, after standardization for relevant covariates. The study had 80\% power to detect an 8\% difference in the change in rates between the study and baseline years at intervention versus control practices. RESULTS: A total of 23 418 visits and 11 919 children were included in the study year and 21 422 visits and 10 667 children in the previous year. The majority of children were male, 5 to 9 years of age, and privately insured. With standardization for selected covariates, captured vaccination opportunities increased from 14.4\% to 18.6\% at intervention sites and from 12.7\% to 16.3\% at control sites, a 0.6\% greater improvement. Standardized influenza vaccination rates improved 3.4\% more at intervention sites than at control sites. The 4 practices with the greatest increases in rates (11\%) were all in the intervention group. Vaccine receipt was more common among children who had been vaccinated previously, with increasing numbers of visits, with care early in the season, and at preventive versus acute care visits.

abstract = {Objective Adolescent immunization rates are suboptimal. Experts recommend provider prompts at health care visits to improve rates. We assessed the impact of either electronic health record (EHR) or nurse- or staff-initiated provider prompts on adolescent immunization rates. Methods We conducted a randomized controlled trial, allocating practices in 1 of 2 practice-based research networks (PBRN) to provider prompts or standard-of-care control. Ten primary care practices participated, 5 intervention and 5 controls, each matched in pairs on urban, suburban, or rural location and practice type (pediatric or family medicine), from a PBRN in Greater Rochester, New York (GR-PBRN); and 12 practices, 6 intervention, 6 controls, similarly matched, from a national pediatric continuity clinic PBRN (CORNET). The study period was 1 year per practice, ranging from June 2011 to January 2013. Study participants were adolescents 11 to 17 years attending these 22 practices; random sample of chart reviews per practice for baseline and postintervention year to assess immunization rates (n = 7,040 total chart reviews for adolescents with >1 visit in a period). The intervention was an EHR prompt (4 GR-PBRN and 5 CORNET practice pairs) (alert) that appeared on providers' computer screens at all office visits, indicating the specific immunizations that adolescents were recommended to receive. Staff prompts (1 GR-PBRN pair and 1 CORNET pair) in the form of a reminder sheet was placed on the provider's desk in the exam room indicating the vaccines due. We compared immunization rates, stratified by PBRN, for routine vaccines (meningococcus, pertussis, human papillomavirus, influenza) at study beginning and end. Results Intervention and control practices within each PBRN were similar at baseline for demographics and immunization rates. Immunization rates at the study end for adolescents who were behind on immunizations at study initiation were not significantly different for intervention versus control practices for any vaccine or combination of vaccines. Results were similar for each PBRN and also when only EHR-based prompts was assessed. For example, at study end, 3-dose human papillomavirus vaccination rates for GR-PBRN intervention versus control practices were 51\% versus 53\% (adjusted odds ratio 0.96; 95\% confidence interval 0.64-1.34); CORNET intervention versus control rates were 50\% versus 42\% (adjusted odds ratio 1.06; 95\% confidence interval 0.68-1.88). Conclusions and Relevance: In both a local and national setting, provider prompts failed to improve adolescent immunization rates. More rigorous practice-based changes are needed.},

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: We found that a clinician-focused intervention was most effective for initiating the HPV vaccine series, whereas a family-focused intervention supported completion. Decision support directed at both clinicians and families most effectively promotes HPV vaccine series receipt. abstract OBJECTIVE: To improve human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates, we studied the effectiveness of targeting automated decision support to families, clinicians, or both. METHODS: Twenty-two primary care practices were cluster-randomized to receive a 3-part clinician-focused intervention (education, electronic health record-based alerts, and audit and feedback) or none. Overall, 22 486 girls aged 11 to 17 years due for HPV vaccine dose 1, 2, or 3 were randomly assigned within each practice to receive family-focused decision support with educational telephone calls. Randomization established 4 groups: family-focused, clinician-focused, combined, and no intervention. We measured decision support effectiveness by final vaccination rates and time to vaccine receipt, standardized for covariates and limited to those having received the previous dose for HPV #2 and 3. The 1-year study began in May 2010. RESULTS: Final vaccination rates for HPV #1, 2, and 3 were 16\%, 65\%, and 63\% among controls. The combined intervention increased vaccination rates by 9, 8, and 13 percentage points, respectively. The control group achieved 15\% vaccination for HPV #1 and 50\% vaccination for HPV #2 and 3 after 318, 178, and 215 days. The combined intervention significantly accelerated vaccination by 151, 68, and 93 days.

We abstracted outcomes, methods, and results from each study and classified by type of intervention conducted. Findings from 34 studies suggest many types of intervention strategies can increase HPV vaccination coverage in different settings, and with modest cost.

We compared the initiation and completion of the HPV vaccine among women in 2 community-based networks with electronic health records: 1 with a prompt and reminder system (prompted cohort) and 1 without (unprompted cohort). Methods: Female patients aged 9 to 26 years seen between March 1, 2007, and January 25, 2010, were used as the retrospective cohort.

However, tournaments are less effective when participants have heterogeneous ability because participants may conclude that the ability gap is too large to be overcome by their effort. Our theoretical analysis shows that a similar loss of motivation arises when tournaments take place over multiple periods because interim performance acts in a way that is similar to heterogeneous ability. Analyzing the sales contests organized by a commodities company, we document that winning participants decrease their effort as their lead extends, whereas the effort of trailing participants fades only when the gap to a winning position is very large. We also show that, on average, when contests are introduced they induce a higher level of effort among participants, although the incentives weaken as the number of participants increases. Finally, we demonstrate that although retailers respond to the multiple performance dimensions of the incentive program in part by shifting effort toward sales of more expensive products, they channel most of the increased effort toward reaching more customers.},

Our work considers two forms of transparency: process transparency, in which customers receive information about the company's sustainability performance relative to other companies, and customer transparency, in which customers receive information about their own sustainability performance relative to other customers. Through three studies with 7,308 participants, we observe that revealing the levels of relative performance is more motivating for customers in the process transparency domain, whereas revealing relative changes in performance is more motivating for customers in the customer transparency domain. We employ structural equation modeling to identify the underlying mechanisms for these results. We show that levels information is more reflective of objective performance comparison, thus strengthening motivation in the domain of process transparency. In contrast, changes information helps to mitigate self-serving attribution biases in the customer transparency domain, thus playing a more significant role in affecting motivation.},

abstract = {Research summary: Exploiting opportunities is critical to a firm's competitive advantage. Not surprisingly, there has been considerable interest in the processes by which top managers allocate attention to potential opportunities. Although such investigations have largely focused on top-down processes for allocating attention to the environment, some studies have explored bottom-up processes. In this article, we consider both top-down and bottom-up processing to develop a model by which top managers form opportunity beliefs for strategic action depending on the allocation of transient and sustained attention. Specifically, this attentional model provides insights into how a top manager's attention is allocated to identify potential opportunities from environmental change and explores how different modes of attentional engagement impact the likelihood of forming beliefs about radical and incremental opportunities requiring strategic action. Managerial summary: Managers are interested in noticing and exploiting opportunities because the exploitation of an opportunity represents an important strategic action. Noticing and exploiting opportunities depends on how and where top managers allocate their attention. Managers can focus attention based on their knowledge and experience or as a result of something in the environment capturing their attention. In this paper, we consider both knowledge-driven and environment-driven processes for allocating attention to form opportunity beliefs. This opportunity belief arises from a two stage process. The first stage explains how a top manager identifies environmental changes as potential opportunities. The second stage explains how the top manager forms a belief that these identified environmental changes represent a radical or incremental opportunity worthy of exploitation},

@article{Kim2020,
abstract = {Providing patients timely care from the appropriate unit not only involves correct clinical evaluation of patient needs, but also requires making admission decisions to effectively manage a unit with limited capacity in the face of stochastic patient arrivals and length-of-stays. We study human decision behavior in this latter operations management task. Using behavioral models and controlled experiments in which physicians and MTurk workers manage a simulated hospital unit, we identify cognitive and environmental factors that drive systematic admission decision bias. We report on two main findings. First, seemingly innocuous "occupancy information hurdles" (operationalized by requiring typing a 10-character password to view current occupancy), causes a chain of events that leads physicians to maintain systematically lower utilization. Specifically, these hurdles cause physicians to make most admission decisions without checking the current unit occupancy. Then-between the times they check-physicians tend to believe there are fewer beds available than there are in reality because occupancy increases from admissions are more salient than occupancy decreases from discharges. Second, decision random error or "noise" leads to higher-or lower-than-optimal utilization of hospital units in a predictable pattern depending on the system parameters. We provide evidence that these patterns are due to some settings providing more "opportunities" for physicians to mistakenly admit too many patients, while other settings provide more opportunity to mistakenly reject too many patients. These two findings enhance our understanding of physician admission control decisions when capacity is limited and generate mitigation strategies for helping clinicians manage hospital unit capacity more efficiently.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Interventions based on behavioral science might reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. OBJECTIVE: To assess effects of behavioral interventions and rates of inappropriate (not guideline-concordant) antibiotic prescribing during ambulatory visits for acute respiratory tract infections. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cluster randomized clinical trial conducted among 47 primary care practices in Boston and Los Angeles. Participants were 248 enrolled clinicians randomized to receive 0,1, 2, or 3 interventions for 18 months. All clinicians received education on antibiotic prescribing guidelines on enrollment. Interventions began between November 1,2011, and October 1,2012. Follow-up for the latest-starting sites ended on April 1, 2014. Adult patients with comorbidities and concomitant infections were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Three behavioral interventions, implemented alone or in combination: suggested alternatives presented electronic order sets suggesting nonantibiotic treatments; accountable justification prompted clinicians to enter free-text justifications for prescribing antibiotics into patients' electronic health records; peer comparison sent emails to clinicians that compared their antibiotic prescribing rates with those of "top performers" (those with the lowest inappropriate prescribing rates). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Antibiotic prescribing rates for visits with antibiotic-inappropriate diagnoses (nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections, acute bronchitis, and influenza) from 18 months preintervention to 18 months afterward, adjusting each intervention's effects for co-occurring interventions and preintervention trends, with random effects for practices and clinicians. RESULTS: There were 14 753 visits (mean patient age, 47 years; 69\% women) for antibiotic-inappropriate acute respiratory tract infections during the baseline period and 16 959 visits (mean patient age, 48 years; 67\% women) duringthe intervention period. Mean antibiotic prescribing rates decreased from 24.1\% at intervention start to 13.1\% at intervention month 18 (absolute difference, -11.0\%) for control practices; from 22.1\% to 6.1\% (absolute difference, -16.0\%) for suggested alternatives (difference in differences, -5.0\% [95\% CI, -7.8\% to 0.1\%]; P =.66 for differences in trajectories); from 23.2\% to 5.2\% (absolute difference, -18.1\%) for accountable justification (difference in differences, -7.0\% [95\% CI, -9.1\% to -2.9\%]; P <.001); and from 19.9\% to 3.7\% (absolute difference, -16.3\%) for peer comparison (difference in differences, -5.2\% [95\% CI, -6.9\% to -1.6\%]; P <.001). There were no statistically significant interactions (neither synergy nor interference) between interventions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among primary care practices, the use of accountable justification and peer comparison as behavioral interventions resulted in lower rates of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory tract infections.},

Using data from randomized natural field experiments at 600,000 treatment and control households across the United States, I estimate that the average program reduces energy consumption by 2.0\%. The program provides additional evidence that non-price interventions can substantially and cost effectively change consumer behavior: the effect is equivalent to that of a short-run electricity price increase of 11 to 20\%, and the cost effectiveness compares favorably to that of traditional energy conservation programs. Perhaps because the treatment included descriptive social norms, effects are heterogeneous: households in the highest decile of pre-treatment consumption decrease usage by 6.3\%, while consumption by the lowest decile decreases by only 0.3\%.

Because only true effects are expected to generate right-skewed p-curves – containing more low (.01s) than high (.04s) significant p-values – only right-skewed p-curves are diagnostic of evidential value.

abstract = {Our job as scientists is to discover truths about the world. We generate hypotheses, collect data, and examine whether or not the data are consistent with those hypotheses. Although we aspire to always be accurate, errors are inevitable. Perhaps the most costly error is a false positive, the incorrect rejection of a null hypothesis. First, once they appear in the literature, false positives are particularly persistent. Because null results have many possible causes, failures to replicate previous findings are never conclusive. Furthermore, because it is uncommon for prestigious journals to publish null findings or exact replications, researchers have little incentive to even attempt them. Second, false positives waste resources: They inspire investment in fruitless research programs and can lead to ineffective policy changes. Finally, a field known for publishing false positives risks losing its credibility. In this article, we show that despite the nominal endorsement of a maximum false-positive rate of 5\% (i.e., p ≤ .05), current standards for disclosing details of data collection and analyses make false positives vastly more likely. In fact, it is unacceptably easy to publish "statistically significant" evidence consistent with any hypothesis. The culprit is a construct we refer to as researcher degrees of freedom. In the course of collecting and analyzing data, researchers have many decisions to make: Should more data be collected? Should some observations be excluded? Which conditions should be combined and which ones compared? Which control variables should be considered? Should specific measures be combined or transformed or both? It is rare, and sometimes impractical, for researchers to make all these decisions beforehand. Rather, it is common (and accepted practice) for researchers to explore various analytic alternatives, to search for a combination that yields "sta-tistical significance," and to then report only what "worked." The problem, of course, is that the likelihood of at least one (of many) analyses producing a falsely positive finding at the 5\% level is necessarily greater than 5\%. This exploratory behavior is not the by-product of malicious intent, but rather the result of two factors: (a) ambiguity in how best to make these decisions and (b) the researcher's desire to find a statistically significant result. A large literature documents that people are self-serving in their interpretation Abstract In this article, we accomplish two things. First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

For each law, we use OLS to compute the DD estimate of its "effect" as well as the standard error of this estimate.

We use Monte Carlo simulations to investi gate how well existing methods help solve this problem. Econometric corrections that place a specific parametric form on the time-series process do not perform well. Bootstrap (taking into account the autocorrelation of the data) works well when the number of states is large enough.

@book{Mintzberg1973,
abstract = {(Review - Link below) Henry Mintzberg is the Roger Barker of the Executive Suite. Just as Barker (1 968) induced behavior setting theory from intensive observation of a handful of Kansans, Mintzberg induces a theory of managerial work from intensive observa- tion of a handful of executives. And just as Barker's work shows the ecological invalidity of some of our most cherished concepts, Mintzberg's work edits the organizational concepts we champion. Rarely has the field of organizational behavior had better evidence of the value of description and induction than is found in Mintzberg's book. And that's surprising, because his data base is mundane. Mintzberg watched five managers, each for one week, and recorded their verbal contacts, phone calls, and handling of mail in chronological order. And that's it. But, as is often the case, bland counting can be conceptually rich. Mintzberg certainly had no shortage of items on which to base his inductions. His five executives studied 659 pieces of incoming mail and generated 231 additional pieces of mail, all of which they interspersed between 368 verbal contacts. Mintzberg then categorized the purpose of each of these 1258 items and then collapsed these purposes into a set of ideas about the characteristics and the content of managerial work. The distinction between characteristics and content is a crucial one. Characteristics include things like where managers work, how long they work, at what pace they work and what media they use to do their work. Characteristics involve the context, the trappings, and the nature of the manager's work flow. This kind of information has been obtained by investiga- tors other than Mintzberg, most notably by those people (for instance, Stewart, Carlson) who had managers keep diaries. Unfortunately, what the diaries don't show is the actual content of what the manager does. The reason is simple. You've got to know in advance what people do if you want them to keep track of the frequency with which they do it. But nowhere in the literature do we have any useful em- pirical statements of just what managers do. And it is this void that Mintzberg set out to fill. In the space of seven chapters, mercifully stripped of method- ology-which is summarized in three appendices-Mintzberg manages to: review the literature on managerial work (Chapter 2); weave together both his own and existing data on charac- teristics of managerial work (Chapter 3); propose ten roles induced from his data that summarize the content of managerial work (Chapter 4); recast all of the preceding chapters into a contingency point of view using such variables as size and nature of industry and managerial style (Chapter 5); and again recast the accumulated material into a provocative set of algorithms for managerial work (Chapter 6), after which he unapologetically and thoughtfully discusses the advice he would give to managers, teachers, and scientists based on what he found. And all of this is done in a book that is read- able, well summarized and indexed, and well illustrated with clear graphics and informative data tables. The essential findings can be summarized quickly. With respect to the characteristics of managerial work, the data show that the manager works at an unrelenting pace with chronic inter- ruptions; he prefers action over reflection and verbal media over written media in his contacts, the majority of which a},

abstract = {This paper documents the effects of last place aversion in queues and its implications for customer experiences and behaviors, as well as for operating performance. An observational analysis of customers queuing at a grocery store, and four online field studies in which participants waited in virtual queues, revealed that waiting in last place diminishes wait satisfaction while increasing the probabilities of switching and abandoning queues, with detrimental implications for service capacity. The research suggests that last place aversion can lead to maladaptive customer behaviors-switching behaviors that increase wait times, and abandoning when the benefits of waiting are most pronounced. The results indicate that this behavior is partially explained by the inability to make a downward social comparison; namely, when no one is behind a queuing individual, that person is less certain that continuing to wait is worthwhile. Furthermore, this paper provides evidence that queue transparency is an effective service design lever that managers can use to reduce the deleterious effects of last place aversion in queues. When people can't see that they're in last place, the behavioral effects of last place aversion are nullified, and when they can see that they're not in last place, the tendency to renege is greatly diminished. Finally, a system-level experiment, in which pairs of queues were created and analyzed, reveals that when the effects of last place aversion are addressed, overall abandonment decreases, such that with equivalent arrival and service rates, total service capacity can be increased.},

The experiment was conducted within a tree-planting firm and provides daily observations on individual worker productivity under both compensation systems. Unrestricted statistical methods estimate the productivity gain to be 20\%. Since planting conditions potentially affect incentives, structural econometric methods are used to generalize the experimental results to out-of-sample conditions. The structural results suggest that the average productivity gain, outside of the experimental conditions, would be at least 21.7\%},

abstract = {Accuracy and consistency are critical for inspections to be an effective, fair, and useful tool for assessing risks, quality, and suppliers-and for making decisions based on those assessments. We examine how inspector schedules could introduce bias that erodes inspection quality by altering inspector stringency. Our analysis of thousands of food safety inspections reveals that inspectors are affected by the inspection outcomes at their prior inspected establishment (outcome effects), citing more violations after they inspect establishments that exhibited worse compliance levels or trends. Moreover, consistent with negativity bias, the effect is stronger after observing compliance deterioration than improvement. Inspection results are also affected by when the inspection occurs within an inspector's day (daily schedule effects): inspectors cite fewer violations after spending more time conducting inspections throughout the day, and when inspections risk prolonging their typical workday. Overall, our findings suggest that currently unreported violations would be cited if the outcome effects-which increase scrutiny-were triggered more often and if the daily schedule effects-which erode scrutiny-were reduced. For example, our estimates indicate that if outcome effects were doubled and daily schedule effects were fully mitigated, 11\% more violations would be detected, enabling remedial actions that could substantially reduce foodborne illnesses and hospitalizations. Understanding and addressing these inspection biases can help managers and policymakers improve not only food safety but also process quality, environmental practices, occupational safety, working conditions, and infrastructure.},

abstract = {Background. The severity of the 2017-2018 influenza season in the United States was high, with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating. Here, we report influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) and estimate the number of vaccine-prevented influenza-associated illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths for the 2017-2018 influenza season. Methods. We used national age-specific estimates of 2017-2018 influenza vaccine coverage and disease burden. We estimated VE against medically attended reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed influenza virus infection in the ambulatory setting using a test-negative design. We used a compartmental model to estimate numbers of influenza-associated outcomes prevented by vaccination. Results. The VE against outpatient, medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza was 38\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 31\%-43\%), including 22\% (95\% CI, 12\%-31\%) against influenza A(H3N2), 62\% (95\% CI, 50\%-71\%) against influenza A(H1N1) pdm09, and 50\% (95\% CI, 41\%-57\%) against influenza B. We estimated that influenza vaccination prevented 7.1 million (95\% CrI, 5.4 million-9.3 million) illnesses, 3.7 million (95\% CrI, 2.8 million-4.9 million) medical visits, 109 000 (95\% CrI, 39 000-231 000) hospitalizations, and 8000 (95\% credible interval [CrI], 1100-21 000) deaths. Vaccination prevented 10\% of expected hospitalizations overall and 41\% among young children (6 months-4 years). Conclusions. Despite 38\% VE, influenza vaccination reduced a substantial burden of influenza-associated illness, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States during the 2017-2018 season. Our results demonstrate the benefit of current influenza vaccination and the need for improved vaccines.},

In all treatments, we find significant overexpenditure of effort relative to the standard theoretical predictions. Identifying subjects through photo display decreases wasteful effort. Providing information feedback about others' effort does not affect the aggregate effort, but it decreases the heterogeneity of effort and significantly affects the dynamics of individual behavior. A behavioral model that incorporates a nonmonetary utility of winning and relative payoff maximization explains significant overexpenditure of effort. It also suggests that decrease in ''social distance'' between group members through social identification promotes prosocial behavior and decreases overexpenditure of effort, while improved information feedback decreases the heterogeneity of effort.},

Using a field experiment in schools and a model of dynamic tournament we examine the effect of different levels of rewards on the rate of quitting. Our experiment indicates that there is a possible tradeoff between performance and quitting. Strong incentives tournaments induced participants to exert more effort and exhibit a better performance but, at the same time, it induces a higher rate of quitting.

We explore three feedback rules: no feedback on relative performance, feedback given halfway through the production period, and continuously updated feedback. We use two pay schemes, a piece rate and a tournament. We find that overall feedback does not improve performance. In contrast to the piece-rate pay scheme there is some evidence of positive peer effects in tournaments since the underdogs almost never quit the competition even when lagging significantly behind, and front runners do not slack off. But in both pay schemes relative performance feedback reduces the quality of the low performers' work; we refer to this as a "negative quality peer effect".},

abstract = {The authors explore the interplay between consumers' progress levels toward attaining a goal and the perceived velocity in progressing toward the goal to determine consumers' motivation for further goal pursuit. The authors propose that when progress toward attaining a goal is low, consumers are primarily concerned about the question "Can I get there?" Thus, a high (vs. low) perceived velocity in progressing suggests greater expectations of goal attainment, resulting in greater motivation for pursuing the goal. However, when consumers have achieved sufficient progress and are approaching the end point, their attainment of the goal is relatively secured, so they become more concerned about the question "When will I get there?" and focus more on whether they are effectively reducing the remaining discrepancy so that they can attain the goal quickly. In this case, a low (vs. high) perceived velocity in progressing elicits greater motivation because it suggests that continued effort is needed to ensure a speedy attainment. Empirical evidence from lab and field experiments supports this hypothesis.},

abstract = {The business press characterized the March 11, 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) as the most significant disruption ever for global supply chains. In the aftermath of the GEJE, there was a great deal of debate about the risks and vulnerabilities of global supply chains and there were calls to redesign and restructure supply chain strategies. To examine this issue, we empirically estimate the effect of the GEJE on the stock prices (or shareholder value) of firms. Our analyses are based on a global sample of 460 publicly traded firms collected from articles and announcements in the business press that identify firms affected by the GEJE. We find that firms experiencing supply chain disruptions due to the GEJE lose on average 3.73\% of their shareholder value during the one month period after the GEJE, and the loss remains roughly at this level when measured over the three month period after the GEJE. This level of loss in shareholder value is economically significant. However, if we consider the claims about the widespread and significant disruptions in supply chains caused by the GEJE, together with the rarity of such an event, the loss does not seem inordinately negative. It suggests that supply chains were probably not that vulnerable to the GEJE, and/or they were able to recover quickly and reduce the losses, indicating that they were fairly resilient. We also find that subsequent to the GEJE, upstream and downstream supply chain propagation effects are negative, the contagion effect on firms related to the nuclear industry is very negative and sustained, and although the competitive effect is positive over the first month after the GEJE, much of this effect dissipates over the next two months.},

abstract = {This paper estimates the shareholder wealth affects of supply chain glitches that resulted in production or shipment delays. The results are based on a sample of 519 glitches announcements made during 1989-2000. Shareholder wealth affects are estimated by computing the abnormal stock returns (actual returns adjusted for industry and market-wide influences) around the date when information about glitches is publicly announced. Supply chain glitch announcements are associated with an abnormal decrease in shareholder value of 10.28\%. Regression analysis is used to identify factors that influence the direction and magnitude of the change in the stock market's reaction to glitches. We find that larger firms experience a less negative market reaction, and firms with higher growth prospects experience a more negative reaction. There is no difference between the stock market's reaction to pre-1995 and post-1995 glitches, suggesting that the market has always viewed glitches unfavorably. Capital structure (debt-equity ratio) has little impact on the stock market's reaction to glitches. We also provide descriptive results on how sources of responsibility and reasons for glitches affect shareholder wealth.},

In this paper, we combine an empirical investigation of the factors affecting nurse absenteeism rates with an analytical treatment of nurse staffing decisions using a novel variant of the newsvendor model. Using data from the emergency department of a large urban hospital, we find that absenteeism rates are consistent with nurses exhibiting an aversion to higher levels of anticipated workload. Using our empirical findings, we analyze a single-period nurse staffing problem considering both the case of constant absenteeism rate (exogenous absenteeism) as well as an absenteeism rate that is a function of the number of nurses scheduled (endogenous absenteeism). We provide characterizations of the optimal staffing levels in both situations and show that the failure to incorporate absenteeism as an endogenous effect results in understaffing.},

abstract = {M edical devices play an increasingly significant role in the delivery of health care today. However, persistent quality problems with medical devices and the associated recalls present potential health risks to patients and personnel using these devices. This study addresses three key issues in this regard. First, it empirically assesses the financial implications of medical device recalls to understand if these consequences are severe enough to deter firms from introducing potentially hazardous medical devices into the market, as can be inferred from the literature. Second, the study considers a cross section of medical device manufacturers to examine the effect of firm characteristics on the costs of poor quality. Third, in an attempt to explore the sources of recalls, this study investigates firm characteristics that are likely to be associated with device recalls. The econometric analyses in the study are based on data from manufacturers in the medical device industry over a four-year period (2002-2005). Contrary to our expectations, the findings of the study indicate that at an aggregate level, the market penalties for medical device recalls are not significant, i.e., at the aggregate level, the costs of poor quality are not severe. Furthermore, we find that the magnitude of financial consequences of device recalls is affected by the product scope, sales, growth prospects, and the capital structure of a firm. In our analyses exploring the sources of device recalls, we find that firms with a research and development focus, developing broader product portfolios, have a higher likelihood of device recalls. Also, we find that the likelihood of recalls decreases with prior recall experience, indicating the presence of learning. Implications of the study findings, limitations, and directions for future research are identified.},

abstract = {National policies to improve health care quality have largely focused on clinical provider outcomes and, more recently, payment reform. Yet the association between hospital leadership and quality, although crucial to driving quality improvement, has not been explored in depth. We collected data from surveys of nationally representative groups of hospitals in the United States and England to examine the relationships among hospital boards, management practices of front-line managers, and the quality of care delivered. First, we found that hospitals with more effective management practices provided higher-quality care. Second, higher-rated hospital boards had superior performance by hospital management staff. Finally, we identified two signatures of high-performing hospital boards and management practice. Hospitals with boards that paid greater attention to clinical quality had management that better monitored quality performance. Similarly, we found that hospitals with boards that used clinical quality metrics more effectively had higher performance by hospital management staff on target setting and operations. These findings help increase understanding of the dynamics among boards, front-line management, and quality of care and could provide new targets for improving care delivery. H ospitals increasingly face financial pressure to improve quality through national programs such as Hospital Value-Based Purchasing, the Hospital Re-admissions Reduction Program, and the Hospital Acquired Condition Reduction Program. Despite the recently increased emphasis by policy makers on linking payment and quality, quality improvement efforts have traditionally focused on the processes and outcomes of clinical providers. Less is known about how two critical elements , leadership and management, influence the delivery of high-quality care and how those effects might be empirically verified. 1 Several previous studies have shown an association between hospital board practices and quality of care. 2-5 Although these studies have been helpful, they have not been able to clearly delineate which specific activities of the boards affect quality of care and how they relate to hospital managers' activities. Furthermore, it is unclear whether board activities and management activities are independently important in driving quality performance. It is known that there are large variations in both how hospital boards engage with clinical quality as well as managerial practices across institutions. 2,5-8 Understanding how hospital boards and management interact with each other, and the way in which they might drive gains in quality, is critically important. The lack of empirical data in this area, however, has},

abstract = {Motivated by a collaborative study with one of the most comprehensive ocular imaging programs in the United States, we investigate the underlying three-way trade-off among operational, clinical, and financial considerations in physicians' decisions about ordering imaging tests. Laboratory tests may be processed in parallel and thus have a limited effect on patients' waiting times; imaging tests, by contrast, require patient presence and thus directly influence patients' waiting times. We use a strategic queueing framework to model a physician's decision of ordering imaging tests and show that insurance coverage is the key driver of overtesting. Our further analysis reveals the following: (i) Whereas existing studies hold that lower out-of-pocket expenses lead to higher consumption levels, we refine this statement by showing the copayment and the coinsurance rate drive the consumption in different directions. Thus, simply expanding patient cost sharing is not the solution to overtesting. (ii) Setting a low reimbursement ceiling alone cannot eliminate overtesting. (iii) The joint effect of misdiagnosis concerns and insurance coverage can lead to both overtesting and undertesting even when no reimbursement ceiling exists. These and other results continue to hold under more general conditions and are therefore robust. We enrich our model along two extensions: one with patient heterogeneity in diagnostic precision, and the other with disparities in health insurance coverage. Our findings have implications for other healthcare settings with similar trade-offs.},

The context is such that rank had no implication for current or future compensation. Compared to a control group with no rank feedback, those employees who received feedback about their rank reduced effort along both the intensive and the extensive margin: they were significantly less likely to return to work and when they did they were less productive when getting feedback about their rank.

Strengthening incentives, either through rankings or tournaments, makes workers more likely to form teams with others of similar ability instead of with their friends. Introducing rank incentives however reduces average productivity by 14\%, whereas introducing a tournament increases it by 24\%. Both effects are heterogeneous: rank incentives only reduce the productivity of teams at the bottom of the productivity distribution, and monetary prize tournaments only increase the productivity of teams at the top. We interpret these results through a theoretical framework that makes precise when the provision of team-based incentives crowds out the productivity-enhancing effect of social connections under team production.},

We study the value of sharing these data in a model with one supplier, N identical retailers, and stationary stochastic consumer demand. There are inventory holding costs and back-order penalty costs. We compare a traditional information policy that does not use shared information with a full information policy that does exploit shared information. In a numerical study we find that supply chain costs are 2.2\% lower on average with the full information policy than with the traditional information policy, and the maximum difference is 12.1\%. We also develop a simulation-based lower bound over all feasible policies. The cost difference between the traditional information policy and the lower bound is an upper bound on the value of information sharing: In the same study, that difference is 3.4\% on average, and no more than 13.8\%. We contrast the value of information sharing with two other benefits of information technology, faster and cheaper order processing, which lead to shorter lead times and smaller batch sizes, respectively. In our sample, cutting lead times nearly in half reduces costs by 21\% on average, and cutting batches in half reduces costs by 22\% on average. For the settings we study, we conclude that implementing information technology to accelerate and smooth the physical flow of goods through a supply chain is significantly more valuable than using information technology to expand the flow of information.},

abstract = {T his paper examines how firm investments in technology-based employee monitoring impact both misconduct and productivity. We use unique and detailed theft and sales data from 392 restaurant locations from five firms that adopt a theft monitoring information technology (IT) product. We use difference-indifferences models with staggered adoption dates to estimate the treatment effect of IT monitoring on theft and productivity. We find significant treatment effects in reduced theft and improved productivity that appear to be primarily driven by changed worker behavior rather than worker turnover. We examine four mechanisms that may drive this productivity result: economic and cognitive multitasking, fairness-based motivation, and perceived increases of general oversight. The observed productivity results represent substantial financial benefits to both firms and the legitimate tip-based earnings of workers. Our results suggest that employee misconduct is not solely a function of individual differences in ethics or morality, but can also be influenced by managerial policies that can benefit both firms and employees.},

abstract = {T his paper explores the rationing of bed capacity in a cardiac intensive care unit (ICU). We find that the length of stay for patients admitted to the ICU is influenced by the occupancy level of the ICU. In particular, a patient is likely to be discharged early when the occupancy in the ICU is high. This in turn leads to an increased likelihood of the patient having to be readmitted to the ICU at a later time. Such "bounce-backs" have implications for the overall ICU effective capacity-an early discharge immediately frees up capacity, but at the risk of a (potentially much higher) capacity requirement when the patient needs to be readmitted. We analyze these capacity implications, shedding light on the question of whether an ICU should apply an aggressive discharge strategy or if it should follow the old quality slogan and "do it right the first time." By comparing the total capacity usage for patients who were discharged early versus those who were not, we show that an aggressive discharge policy applied to patients with lower clinical severity levels frees up capacity in the ICU. However, we find that an increased number of readmissions of patients with high clinical severity levels occur when the ICU is capacity constrained, thereby effectively reducing peak bed capacity.},

However, not only can some supply chains continue to function smoothly, they also continue to satisfy their customers before and after a major disruption. Some key differentiators of these supply chains are cost-effective and time-efficient strategies. In this paper, certain "robust" strategies are presented that possess two properties. First, these strategies will enable a supply chain to manage the inherent fluctuations efficiently regardless of the occurrence of major disruptions. Second, these strategies will make a supply chain become more resilient in the face of major disruptions. While there are costs for implementing these strategies, they provide additional selling points for acquiring and retaining apprehensive customers before and after a major disruption.},

abstract = {W e study a single-product setting in which a firm can source from two suppliers, one that is unreliable and another that is reliable but more expensive. Suppliers are capacity constrained, but the reliable supplier may possess volume flexibility. We prove that in the special case in which the reliable supplier has no flexibility and the unreliable supplier has infinite capacity, a risk-neutral firm will pursue a single disruption-management strategy: mitigation by carrying inventory, mitigation by single-sourcing from the reliable supplier, or passive acceptance. We find that a supplier's percentage uptime and the nature of the disruptions (frequent but short versus rare but long) are key determinants of the optimal strategy. For a given percentage uptime, sourcing mitigation is increasingly favored over inventory mitigation as disruptions become less frequent but longer. Further, we show that a mixed mitigation strategy (partial sourcing from the reliable supplier and carrying inventory) can be optimal if the unreliable supplier has finite capacity or if the firm is risk averse. Contingent rerouting is a possible tactic if the reliable supplier can ramp up its processing capacity, that is, if it has volume flexibility. We find that contingent rerouting is often a component of the optimal disruption-management strategy, and that it can significantly reduce the firm's costs. For a given percentage uptime, mitigation rather than contingent rerouting tends to be optimal if disruptions are rare.},

abstract = {W e study a manufacturer that faces a supplier privileged with private information about supply disruptions. We investigate how risk-management strategies of the manufacturer change and examine whether risk-management tools are more or less valuable in the presence of such asymmetric information. We model a supply chain with one manufacturer and one supplier, in which the supplier's reliability is either high or low and is the supplier's private information. On disruption, the supplier chooses to either pay a penalty to the manufacturer for the shortfall or use backup production to fill the manufacturer's order. Using mechanism design theory, we derive the optimal contract menu offered by the manufacturer. We find that information asymmetry may cause the less reliable supplier type to stop using backup production while the more reliable supplier type continues to use it. Additionally, the manufacturer may stop ordering from the less reliable supplier type altogether. The value of supplier backup production for the manufacturer is not necessarily larger under symmetric information; for the more reliable supplier type, it could be negative. The manufacturer is willing to pay the most for information when supplier backup production is moderately expensive. The value of information may increase as supplier types become uniformly more reliable. Thus, higher reliability need not be a substitute for better information.},

How much (if any) pricing discretion headquarters should grant is a topic of debate within many firms. We investigate this issue using a unique data set from an indirect lender with local pricing discretion. We estimate that the local sales force adjusted prices in a way that improved profits by approximately 11\% on average. A counterfactual analysis shows that using a centralized, data-driven pricing optimization system could improve profits even further, up to 20\% over those actually realized. This suggests that centralized pricing-if appropriately optimized-can be more effective than field price discretion. We discuss the implications of these findings for auto lending and other industries with similar pricing processes.},

abstract = {T his work examines the process of admission to a hospital's intensive care unit (ICU). ICUs currently lack systematic admission criteria, largely because the impact of ICU admission on patient outcomes has not been well quantified. This makes evaluating the performance of candidate admission strategies difficult. Using a large patient-level data set of more than 190,000 hospitalizations across 15 hospitals, we first quantify the cost of denied ICU admission for a number of patient outcomes. We use hospital operational factors as instrumental variables to handle the endogeneity of the admission decisions and identify important specification issues that are required for this approach to be valid. Using the quantified cost estimates, we then provide a simulation framework for evaluating various admission strategies' performance. By simulating a hospital with 21 ICU beds, we find that we could save about 1.9 million per year by using an optimal policy based on observables designed to reduce readmissions and hospital length of stay. We also discuss the role of unobserved patient factors, which physicians may discretionarily account for when making admission decisions, and show that including these unobservables could result in a more than threefold increase in benefits compared to just optimizing the policy over the observable patient factors.},

abstract = {R etail store managers may not follow order advices generated by an automated inventory replenishment system if their incentives differ from the cost-minimization objective of the system or if they perceive the system to be suboptimal. We study the ordering behavior of retail store managers in a supermarket chain to characterize such deviations in ordering behavior, investigate their potential drivers, and thereby devise a method to improve automated replenishment systems. Using orders, shipments, and point-of-sale data for 19,417 item-store combinations over five stores, we show that (i) store managers consistently modify automated order advices by advancing orders from peak to nonpeak days, and (ii) this behavior is explained significantly by product characteristics such as case pack size relative to average demand per item, net shelf space, product variety, demand uncertainty, and seasonality error. Our regression results suggest that store managers improve upon the automated replenishment system by incorporating two ignored factors: in-store handling costs and sales improvement potential through better in-stock. Based on these results, we construct a method to modify automated order advices by learning from the behavior of store managers. Motivated by the management coefficients theory, our method is efficient to implement and outperforms store managers by achieving a more balanced handling workload with similar average days of inventory.},

Our findings, using data from one of the largest financial services providers in the United States, indicate that customer sensitivity to service time varies widely and predictably with observable market characteristics. In turn, we find evidence that local operating managers account for market-specific customer sensitivities to service times by deviating frequently and in predictable ways from the recommendations offered by a centralized capacity-planning model. Finally, we document that these discretionary capacity supply decisions exhibit a strong learning effect whereby experienced operating managers place more weight than their less-experienced counterparts on the market-specific trade-off between service capacity costs and customer sensitivity to service times. Overall, our results demonstrate both the importance of local knowledge as an input in service operations and the potential for incorporating richer data on customer behavior and preferences into service cost and productivity standard metrics.},

The existing policy consists of a daily payment for each patient under care with a global cap of revenues accrued during the Medicare year, which increases with each newly admitted patient. We investigate the hospice's expected profit and provide reasons for a spate of recent provider bankruptcies related to the reimbursement policy; recommendations to alleviate these problems are given. We also analyze a hospice's incentives for patient management, finding several unintended consequences of the Medicare reimbursement policy. Specifically, a hospice may seek short-lived patients (such as cancer patients) over patients with longer expected lengths of stay. The effort with which hospices seek out, or recruit, such patients will vary during the year. Furthermore, the effort they apply to actively discharge a patient whose condition has stabilized may also depend on the time of year. These phenomena are unintended and undesirable but are a direct consequence of the Medicare reimbursement policy. We propose an alternative reimbursement policy to ameliorate these shortcomings.},

We take an economic and operational (patient flow) perspective to analyze the effectiveness of this policy in encouraging hospitals to reduce readmissions. We develop a game-theoretic model that captures the competition among hospitals inherent in HRRP's benchmarking mechanism. We show that this competition can be counterproductive: it increases the number of nonincentivized hospitals, which prefer paying penalties over reducing readmissions in any equilibrium. We calibrate our model with a data set of more than 3,000 hospitals in the United States and show that under the current policy, and for a large set of parameters, 4\%-13\% of the hospitals remain nonincentivized to reduce readmissions. We also validate our model against the actual performance of hospitals in the three years since the introduction of the policy. We draw several policy recommendations to improve this policy's outcome. For example, localizing the benchmarking process-comparing hospitals against similar peers-improves the performance of the policy.},

abstract = {"A Caravan book"--Title page verso. "Every day, we make decisions on topics ranging from personal investments to schools for our children to the meals we eat to the causes we champion. Unfortunately, we often choose poorly. Nobel laureate Richard Thaler and legal scholar and bestselling author Cass Sunstein explain in this important exploration of choice architecture that, being human, we all are susceptible to various biases that can lead us to blunder. Our mistakes make us poorer and less healthy; we often make bad decisions involving education, personal finance, health care, mortgages and credit cards, the family, and even the planet itself. In Nudge, Thaler and Sunstein invite us to enter an alternative world, one that takes our humanness as a given. They show that by knowing how people think, we can design choice environments that make it easier for people to choose what is best for themselves, their families, and their society. Using colorful examples from the most important aspects of life, Thaler and Sunstein demonstrate how thoughtful "choice architecture" can be established to nudge us in beneficial directions without restricting freedom of choice. Nudge offers a unique new take--from neither the left nor the right--on many hot-button issues, for individuals and governments alike. This is one of the most engaging and provocative books to come along in many years."

@article{Chopra2004,
abstract = {Natural disasters, labor disputes, terrorism and more mundane risks can seriously disrupt or delay the flow of material, information and cash through an organization's supply chain. The authors assert that how well a company fares against such threats will depend on its level of preparedness, and the type of disruption. Each supply-chain risk to forecasts, information systems, intellectual property, procurement, inventory and capacity has its own drivers and effective mitigation strategies. To avoid lost sales, increased costs or both, managers need to tailor proven risk-reduction strategies to their organizations. Managing supply-chain risk is difficult, however. Dell, Toyota, Motorola and other leading manufacturers excel at identifying and neutralizing supply-chain risks through a delicate balancing act: keeping inventory, capacity and related elements at appropriate levels across the entire supply chain in a rapidly changing environment. Organizations can prepare for or avoid delays by "smart sizing" their capacity and inventory. The manager serves as a kind of financial portfolio manager, seeking to achieve the highest achievable profits (reward) for varying levels of supply-chain risk. The authors recommend a powerful "what if?" team exercise called "stress testing" to identify potentially weak links in the supply chain. Armed with this shared understanding, companies can then select the best mitigation strategy: holding "reserves," pooling inventory, using redundant suppliers, balancing capacity and inventory, implementing robust backup and recovery systems, adjusting pricing and incentives, bringing or keeping production in-house, and using Continuous Replenishment Programs (CRP), Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR) and other supply-chain initiatives.},

The basic premise of this research is that an individual's conscious ideas his actions. Studies are cited demonstrating that: (1) hard goals produce a higher level of performance (output) than easy goals; (2) specific hard goals produce a higher level of output than a goal of "de your best"; and (3) behavioral intentions regulate choice behavior. The also views goals and intentions as mediators of the effects of incentives on task performance. Evidence is presented supporting the view that monetary incentives, time limits, and knowledge of results do not affect performance level independently of the individual's goals and intentions. A theoretical analysis supports the same view with respect to three other incentives: participation, competition, and praise and re-proof. Finally, behavioral intentions were found to mediate the effects of money and "verbal reinforcement" on choice behavior. It is concluded that any adequate theory of task motivation must take account of the indi-vidual's conscious goals and intentions. The applied implications of the theory are discussed.},

Vaccination strategies to reduce disease burden have been implemented. However, no previous studies have systematically estimated the annual economic burden of influenza epidemics, an estimate necessary to guide policy makers effectively. Objective: We estimate age-and risk-specific disease burden, and medical and indirect costs attributable to annual influenza epidemics in the United States. Methods: Using a probabilistic model and publicly available epidemiological data we estimated the number of influenza-attributable cases leading to outpatient visits, hospitalization, and mortality, as well as time lost from work absenteeism or premature death. With data from health insurance claims and projections of either earnings or statistical life values, we then estimated healthcare resource utilization associated with influenza cases as were their medical and productivity (indirect) costs in 2003. Results: Based on 2003 US population, we estimated that annual influenza epidemics resulted in an average of 610,660 life-years lost (undiscounted), 3.1 million hospitalized days, and 31.4 million outpatient visits.},

Past evidence suggests that the committee could use a more systematic approach to incorporate observed information and to quantify the risks associated with different options. There are two key trade-offs involved in this decision. First, if the Committee decides to retain the current vaccine composition instead of updating to a new one, there is lower uncertainty in production yields, but the current vaccine could be less effective if a new virus strain spreads. Second, if the Committee decides early with less information, then manufacturers have more production time, but the reduced information increases the risk of choosing a wrong strain. We derive an optimal dynamic policy for this decision. Because of the greater uncertainty in production yields of new vaccines, the optimal thresholds are neither symmetric between retaining and updating the composition nor monotonic over time. We apply our model to past decisions using parameter values estimated from a historical case. Our analysis shows that the dynamic optimal policy can significantly improve social welfare.},

Previous economic studies, focusing on demand side, find that the equilibrium demand is always less than the socially optimal demand because self-interested individuals do not internalize the social benefit of protecting others via reduced infectiousness (positive exter-nality). In contrast, we show that the equilibrium demand can be greater than the socially optimal demand after accounting for the limited supply due to yield uncertainty and manufacturer's incentives. The main driver for this result is a second (negative) externality: Self-interested individuals ignore that vaccinating people with high infection costs is more beneficial for the society when supply is limited. We show that the extent of the negative externality can be reduced through more efficient and less uncertain allocation mechanisms. To investigate the relative effectiveness of government interventions on supply and demand sides under various demand and supply characteristics, we construct two partially centralized scenarios where the social planner (i.e., government) intervenes either on the demand side or the supply side, but not both.

Numerous studies have suggested that the performance of a division, plant, or business unit is improved to the extent that it remains focused on a narrow range of activities. Others have found similar benefits associated with focus at the level of the entire firm. A question that has received less attention, however, is whether focus at the divisional level is complementary with, or a substitute for, focus at the firm level. We explore this question by considering the performance of investigative sites in biopharmaceutical clinical trials. First, we establish that firms focusing on a particular task-at either a divisional or firm level-experience higher output and productivity with respect to that task than unfocused firms. After controlling for selection, scale, and learning effects, we find that sites that focus on conducting clinical trials significantly outperform those that mix trial activity with the provision of traditional patient care. Second, we find evidence that focus at the divisional level and firm level are substitutes. That is, organizations characterized by divisional focus alone achieve statistically similar performance to sites that are characterized by both divisional and firm focus.},

abstract = {The long-standing argument that focused operations outperform others stands in contrast to claims about the
benefits of broader operational scope. The performance benefits of focus are typically attributed to reduced
complexity, lower uncertainty, and the development of specialized expertise; the benefits of greater breadth are
linked to the economies of scope achieved by sharing common resources, such as advertising or production
capacity, across activities. Within the literature on corporate strategy, this tension between focus and breadth is
reconciled by the concept of related diversification (i.e., a firm with multiple operating units, each specializing
in distinct but related activities). We consider whether there are similar benefits to related diversification within
an operating unit and examine the mechanism that generates these benefits. Using the empirical context of
cardiovascular care within hospitals, we first examine the relationship between a hospital's level of specialization
in cardiovascular care and the quality of its clinical performance on cardiovascular patients. We find that, on
average, focus has a positive effect on quality performance. We then distinguish between positive spillovers and
complementarities to examine (1) the extent to which a hospital's specialization in areas related to cardiovascular
care directly impacts performance on cardiovascular patients (positive spillovers) and (2) whether the marginal
benefit of a hospital's focus in cardiovascular care depends on the degree to which the hospital “cospecializes” in
related areas (complementarities). In our setting, we find evidence of such complementarities in specialization},

abstract = {US guidelines provided a permissive recommendation for HPV vaccine for males in 2009, with an updated recommendation for routine vaccination in 2011. Data on vaccine uptake among males, however, remain sparse. We analyzed 2010-2011 data (collected mostly prior to the recommendation for routine vaccination) from the National Immunization Survey-Teen for a nationally representative sample of adolescent males ages 13-17 (n = 22,365). We examined HPV vaccine initiation (receipt of at least one dose based on healthcare provider records) as the primary outcome. Analyses used weighted logistic regression. HPV vaccine initiation increased from 1.4\% in 2010 to 8.3\% in 2011. Parents who reported receiving a healthcare provider recommendation to get their sons HPV vaccine were much more likely to have vaccinated sons (OR = 19.02, 95\% CI: 14.36-25.19). Initiation was also higher among sons who were Hispanic (OR = 1.83, 95\% CI: 1.24-2.71) or who were eligible for the Vaccines for Children program (OR = 1.53, 95\% CI: 1.01-2.31). Only 31.0\% of parents with unvaccinated sons indicated their sons were "somewhat likely" or "very likely" to receive HPV vaccine in the next year. The most common main reasons for parents not intending to vaccinate were believing vaccination is not needed or not necessary (24.5\%), not having received a provider recommendation (22.1\%), and lack of knowledge (15.9\%). HPV vaccination is low among adolescent males in the US, and provider recommendation for vaccination is likely key to improving vaccine uptake. Given the updated recommendation for routine vaccination and the changes in health insurance coverage that are likely to follow, continued efforts are needed to monitor HPV vaccination among males.},

abstract = {Work scheduling research typically prescribes task sequences implemented by managers. Yet employees often have discretion to deviate from their prescribed sequence. Using data from 2.4 million radiological diagnoses, we find that doctors prioritize similar tasks (batching) and those tasks they expect to complete faster (shortest expected processing time). Moreover, they exercise more discretion as they accumulate experience. Exploiting random assignment of tasks to doctors' queues, instrumental variable models reveal that these deviations erode productivity. This productivity decline lessens as doctors learn from experience. Prioritizing the shortest tasks is particularly detrimental to productivity. Actively grouping similar tasks also reduces productivity, in stark contrast to productivity gains from exogenous grouping, indicating deviation costs outweigh benefits from repetition. By analyzing task completion times, our work highlights the tradeoffs between the time required to exercise discretion and the potential gains from doing so, which has implications for how discretion over scheduling should be delegated},

abstract = {We use a detailed operational and clinical data set from a maternity hospital to investigate how workload affects decisions in gatekeeper-provider systems, where the servers act as gatekeepers to specialists but may also attempt to serve customers themselves , albeit with a probability of success that is decreasing in the complexity of the customers' needs. We study the effect of workload during a service episode on gatekeep-ers' service configuration decisions and the rate at which gatekeepers refer customers to a specialist. We find that gatekeeper-providers (midwives in our context) make substantial use of two levers to manage their workload (measured as patients per midwife): they ration resource-intensive discretionary services (epidural analgesia) for customers with noncomplex service needs (mothers with spontaneous onset of labor) and, at the same time, increase the rate of specialist referral (physician-led delivery) for customers with complex needs (mothers with pharmacologically induced labor). The workload effect in the study unit is surprisingly large and comparable in size to those for leading clinical risk factors: when workload increases from two standard deviations below to two standard deviations above the mean, noncomplex cases are 28.8\% less likely to receive an epidu-ral, leading to a cost reduction of 8.7\%, while complex cases are 14.2\% more likely to be referred for a physician-led delivery, leading to a cost increase of 2.6\%. These observations are consistent with overtreatment at both high and low workload levels, albeit for different types of patients, and suggest that smoothing gatekeeper workload would reduce variability in customer service experience.

abstract = {Public relative performance feedback (RPF) on an individual worker's productivity metrics is used in various organizations with the hopes of improving worker productivity , but its effects are not well understood. We examine whether public RPF could be leveraged to facilitate adoption of best practices in an organization by enabling the validation of best practices shared by identifiable top performers. We use data from two emergency departments, both of which shared best practices for improving productivity and one of which changed from privately to publicly disclosing RPF to physicians. The public disclosure of RPF allowed workers to identify their top-performing coworkers, which in turn enabled the identification and validation of best practices within the work group. We find that the intervention is associated with a 10.9\% improvement in physician productivity. We also find evidence for a significant reduction in variation in productivity across providers, which stems from bottom-ranked workers exhibiting differentially large improvements in productivity. These effects hold without sacrificing system-level performance , service quality, or worker attrition. Our results suggest that public disclosure of RPF, along with the validation of the best practices being shared, can improve worker productivity.

To evaluate the association between an active choice intervention in the electronic health record (EHR) and changes in influenza vaccination rates. Observational study. Adults eligible for influenza vaccination with a clinic visit at one of three internal medicine practices at the University of Pennsylvania Health System between September 2010 and March 2013. The EHR confirmed patient eligibility during the clinic visit and, upon accessing the patient chart, prompted the physician and their medical assistant to actively choose to "accept" or "cancel" an order for the influenza vaccine. Change in influenza vaccination order rates at the intervention practice compared to two control practices for the 2012-2013 flu season, comparing trends during the prior two flu seasons adjusting for time trends and patient and clinic visit characteristics. The sample (n = 45,926 patients) was 62.9\% female, 35.9\% white, and 54.4\% black, with a mean age of 50.2 years. Trends were similar between practices during the 2 years in the pre-intervention period. Vaccination rates increased in both groups in the post-intervention year, but the intervention practice using active choice had a significantly greater increase than the control (adjusted difference-in-difference: 6.6 percentage points; 95\% CI, 5.1-8.1; P < 0.001), representing a 37.3\% relative increase compared to the pre-intervention period. More than 99.9\% (9938/9941) of orders placed during the study period resulted in vaccination. Active choice through the EHR was associated with a significant increase in influenza vaccination rates.},

Goal-setting literature suggests that workers respond to challenging but achievable goals with increased performance. Empirical evidence supports the notion of goals increasing performance; however the evidence on how attainability of goals affects performance is mixed. This paper tests whether efforts increase, improving performance as the goals become more attainable. We are employing a unique set of publicly available marathon data from 1970 to 2015 to directly analyze the effect of goal attainability on performance. With the probable goal of qualifying for the Boston Marathon, we test if runners increase their effort, and consequently improve their performance if they enter a new age group and as a result have a more attainable goal. We find that runners who enter a new age group perform better than the runners whose qualifying time did not change. This effect is seen with runners in younger age groups, but not found in the results of runners in more advanced years.},

abstract = {Performance rankings are a very common workplace management practice. Behavioral theories suggest that providing performance rankings to employees, even without pecuniary consequences, may directly shape effort due to the rank's effect on self-image. In a three-year randomized control trial with full-time furniture salespeople (n=1754), I study the effect on sales performance in a two-by-two experimental design where I vary (i) whether to privately inform employees about their performance rank; and (ii) whether to give benchmarks, i.e. data on the current performance required to be in the top 10\%, 25\% and 50\%. The salespeople's compensation is only based on absolute performance via a high-powered commission scheme in which rankings convey no direct additional financial benefits. There are two important innovations in this experiment. First, prior to the start of the experiment all salespeople were told their performance ranking. Second, employees operate in a multi-tasking environment where they can sell multiple brands. There are four key results: First, removing rank feedback actually increases sales performance by 11\%, or 1/10 th of a standard deviation. Second, only men (not women) change their performance. Third, adding benchmarks to rank feedback significantly raises performance, but it is not significantly different from providing no feedback. Fourth, as predicted by the multi-tasking model, the treatment effect increases with the scope for effort substitution across furniture brands as employees switch their effort to other tasks when their rank is worse than expected.},

abstract = {We evaluate the results of a field experiment designed to measure the effect of prompts to form implementation intentions on realized behavioral outcomes. The outcome of interest is influenza vaccination receipt at free on-site clinics offered by a large firm to its employees. All employees eligible for study participation received reminder mailings that listed the times and locations of the relevant vaccination clinics. Mailings to employees randomly assigned to the treatment conditions additionally included a prompt to write down either (i) the date the employee planned to be vaccinated or (ii) the date and time the employee planned to be vaccinated. Vaccination rates increased when these implementation intentions prompts were included in the mailing. The vaccination rate among control condition employees was 33.1\%. Employees who received the prompt to write down just a date had a vaccination rate 1.5 percentage points higher than the control group, a difference that is not statistically significant. Employees who received the more specific prompt to write down both a date and a time had a 4.2 percentage point higher vaccination rate, a difference that is both statistically significant and of meaningful magnitude. behavioral economics | nudge | libertarian paternalism | public health | flu shot S easonal influenza leads to >200,000 hospitalizations and >8,000 deaths in the United States each year (1, 2). The influenza vaccine is widely available at low cost and reduces mortality (3-5), morbidity (3-6), and healthcare costs (3, 6). Nevertheless, many of those for whom vaccination is indicated fail to comply with CDC recommendations for vaccination (7). If low compliance is the result of careful calculations by individuals weighing the costs and benefits of vaccination, it may be difficult and expensive for policymakers and organizational leaders to increase vaccination rates. However, if low compliance is the result of forgetfulness or procrastination, low-cost interventions that use psychological tools may be effective at increasing vaccination rates and improving public health. The potential for low-cost psychological interventions to change behavior has been documented in previous research (8-10). For example, changing defaults-the outcomes that result when no action is taken-has been shown to have a sizeable effect on organ donation rates (11), immunization rates (12), and savings plan enrollment (13). Providing information on social norms has been used to reduce household energy consumption (14, 15). This paper evaluates another behavioral intervention-planning prompts-in a field setting. Research in psychology has demonstrated that prompting people to develop a plan of the form, "When situation x arises, I will implement response y," increases attainment of desired goals (16-20). Simply asking people to develop such a plan, or an "imple-mentation intention," is all that is necessary to trigger an association between the desired behavior and a concrete future moment (19). A prompt to form an implementation intention is a "nudge" (8) in the direction of desired behavior that can be applied at minimal expense and does not restrict individual autonomy (9). To investigate the efficacy of implementation intentions prompts, we conducted a three-arm randomized controlled trial. The outcome of interest was influenza vaccination receipt. Employees at a large firm were randomly assigned to receive one of three mailings about workplace vaccination clinics. All mailings informed recipients of the dates and times of clinics at their work location. In addition, some mailers prompted recipients to write down either (i) the date they planned to get their vaccination (date plan condition), or (ii) the date and time they planned to get their vaccination (time plan condition). Fig. 1 shows the component of the mailer that varied across conditions. Comparing the vaccination rates of employees in the two treatment conditions to the vaccination rates of employees in the control condition whose mailers did not include an implementation intentions prompt, we find that vaccination rates were increasing in the specificity of the prompt received. The vaccination rate among control condition employees was 33.1\%. Employees who received the prompt to write down just a date had a regression adjusted vaccination rate 1.5 percentage points higher than the control group, a difference that is not statistically significant at the 5\% level. Those who received the more specific prompt to write down both a date and a time had a 4.2 percentage point higher regression-adjusted vaccination rate, a difference that is both statistically significant at the 5\% level and of a meaningful magnitude. The intervention had a larger impact at sites that offered vaccination clinics on only one day than at sites that offered clinics on multiple days, suggesting that implementation intentions prompts may be more effective in settings where an opportunity is available for only a short time. To our knowledge, this is the first large field study to evaluate the power of implementation intentions prompts in isolation and without confounding influences. Although past research has demonstrated that planning interventions can increase the frequency of prompted behavior for various outcomes ranging from mammography to voting (19), our study differs from past research in several important ways. First, in many past studies, the effect of the planning intervention could not be distinguished from the effect of social pressure because the intervention involved face-to-face or telephone contact (16, 20-24). This study does not involve social pressure: whether subjects ignored the mailings was not observed, and any plans formulated were not communicated to the experimenters, the employer, or any other party. Second, the treatment conditions in many previous studies have provided subjects with supplemental information that was relevant to the outcome participants were being prompted to},

abstract = {W e analyze a large, detailed operational data set from a restaurant chain to shed new light on how workload (defined as the number of tables or diners that a server simultaneously handles) affects servers' performance (measured as sales and meal duration). We use an exogenous shock-the implementation of labor scheduling software-and time-lagged instrumental variables to disentangle the endogeneity between demand and supply in this setting. We show that servers strive to maximize sales and speed efforts simultaneously, depending on the relative values of sales and speed. As a result, we find that, when the overall workload is small, servers expend more and more sales efforts with the increase in workload at a cost of slower service speed. However, above a certain workload threshold, servers start to reduce their sales efforts and work more promptly with the further rise in workload. In the focal restaurant chain, we find that this saturation point is currently not reached and, counterintuitively, the chain can reduce the staffing level and achieve both significantly higher sales (an estimated 3\% increase) and lower labor costs (an estimated 17\% decrease).},

abstract = {M uch of prior work in the area of service operations management has assumed service rates to be exogenous to the level of load on the system. Using operational data from patient transport services and cardiotho-racic surgery-two vastly different health-care delivery services-we show that the processing speed of service workers is influenced by the system load. We find that workers accelerate the service rate as load increases. In particular, a 10\% increase in load reduces length of stay by two days for cardiothoracic surgery patients, whereas a 20\% increase in the load for patient transporters reduces the transport time by 30 seconds. Moreover, we show that such acceleration may not be sustainable. Long periods of increased load (overwork) have the effect of decreasing the service rate. In cardiothoracic surgery, an increase in overwork by 1\% increases length of stay by six hours. Consistent with prior studies in the medical literature, we also find that overwork is associated with a reduction in quality of care in cardiothoracic surgery-an increase in overwork by 10\% is associated with an increase in likelihood of mortality by 2\%. We also find that load is associated with an early discharge of patients, which is in turn correlated with a small increase in mortality rate.},

Four studies were conducted to test whether perceived goal progress hinders the pursuit of the focal goal. These studies demonstrate that in the course of self-regulation progress along one goal liberates people to pursue inconsistent goals. Furthermore, merely planning to make goal progress in the future may facilitate incongruent choice of immediate action.},

Although the intervention successfully improved the target behavior, less is known about any spillovers, positive or negative, that impacted the program's net benefit. This novel examination presents an opportunity to advance our knowledge of this important question, particularly because many theories predict that balancing behaviors in other domains (e.g., reduced exercise) can occur. Our results show a positive and long-lasting persistence effect for the treatment group, even after the incentive was removed. Moreover, we observe no negative spillover effects into related domains such as exercise, and no negative impact on customer loyalty. These results support the use of incentive-based interventions and highlight the importance, for both theory and practice, of examining their extended effects.

The experiment was designed to assess local and short-term effects as well as spatial and temporal substitution, heterogeneity, and spillovers. Subjects offered 5, 10, and 15 gift cards to give blood were more likely to donate and more so for the higher reward values. The incentives also led to spatial displacement and a short-term shift in the timing of donation activity, but they had no long-term effects. Many of the effects were also heterogeneous in the population. We also detected a spillover effect whereby informing some individuals of rewards through official ARC channels led others who were not officially informed to be more likely to donate. Thus, the effect of incentives on prosocial behavior includes not only the immediate local effects but also spatial displacement, social spillovers, and dramatic heterogeneity. We discuss the implications of these findings for organizations with activities that rely on volunteers for the supply of key inputs or products as well as for government agencies and public policy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Low human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination coverage is an urgent public health problem requiring action. To identify policy remedies to suboptimal HPV vaccination, we assessed the relationship between states' school entry requirements and adolescent vaccination. METHODS We gathered data on states' school entry requirements for adolescent vaccination (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis [Tdap] booster; meningococcal; and HPV) from 2007 to 2012 from Immunization Action Coalition. The National Immunization Survey-Teen provided medical record-verified vaccination data for 99 921 adolescents. We calculated coverage (among 13- to 17-year-olds) for individual vaccinations and concomitant vaccination. HPV vaccination outcomes were among female adolescents. Analyses used weighted longitudinal multivariable models. RESULTS States with requirements for Tdap booster and meningococcal vaccination had 22 and 24 percentage point increases in coverage for these vaccines, respectively, compared with other states (both P < .05). States with HPV vaccination requirements had <1 percentage point increase in coverage for this vaccine (P < .05). Tdap booster and meningococcal vaccination requirements, respectively, were associated with 8 and 4 percentage point spillover increases for HPV vaccination coverage (both P < .05) and with increases for concomitant vaccination (all P < .05). CONCLUSIONS Ensuring all states have meningococcal vaccination requirements could improve the nation's HPV vaccination coverage, given that many states already require Tdap booster but not meningococcal vaccination for school entry. Vaccination programs and clinicians should capitalize on changes in adolescent vaccination, including concomitant vaccination, that may arise after states adopt vaccination requirements. Additional studies are needed on the effects of HPV vaccination requirements and opt-out provisions.},

This systematization opens the door to precise quantitative inference in small-sample comparative studies, without precluding the application of qualitative approaches. Borrowing the expression from Sidney Tarrow, the synthetic control method allows researchers to put “qualitative flesh on quantitative bones.”We illustrate the main ideas behind the synthetic control method by estimating the economic impact of the 1990 German reunification onWest Germany.},

We demonstrate that following Proposition 99 tobacco consumption fell markedly in California relative to a comparable synthetic con- trol region. We estimate that by the year 2000 annual per capita cigarette sales in California were about 26 packs lower than what they would have been in the absence of Proposition 99. Using new inferential methods proposed in this ar- ticle, we demonstrate the significance of our estimates. Given that many policy interventions and events of interest in social sciences take place at an aggregate level (countries, regions, cities, etc.) and affect a small number of aggregate units, the potential applicability of synthetic control methods to comparative case studies is very large, especially in situations where traditional regression methods are not appropriate},

Using a real-effort experiment, we aim to discover whether people respond to the specific rank that they achieve. In particular, we leverage random variation in the allocation of rank among subjects who exerted the same effort to obtain a causal estimate of the rank response function that describes how effort provision responds to the content of rank-order feedback. We find that the rank response function is U-shaped. Subjects exhibit 'first-place loving' and 'last-place loathing', that is subjects work hardest after being ranked first or last.

abstract = {I n this paper, we study how social planners should exploit social comparisons to pursue their objectives. We consider two modes of social comparison, referred to as behind-averse and ahead-seeking behaviors, depending on whether individuals experience a utility loss from underperforming or a utility gain from overperforming relative to their peers. Modeling social comparison as a game between players, we find that ahead-seeking behavior leads to output polarization, whereas behind-averse behavior leads to output clustering. A social planner can mitigate these effects in two ways: (i) by providing the full reference distribution of outputs instead of an aggregate reference point based on the average output and (ii) by assigning players into uniform rather than diverse reference groups. Social planners may thus need to tailor the reference structure to the predominant mode of social comparison and their objective. A performance-focused social planner may set the reference structure so as to maximize the output of either the top or the bottom player depending on whether she puts greater marginal weight to larger or smaller outputs. When the social planner also cares about utility, she faces a dilemma because performance optimization may not be aligned with utility maximization. Inevitably, the social planner will have to confront equity issues because better performance may not reflect greater effort or greater ability.},

We investigate experimentally the role of status-seeking behavior in sabotage and cheating activities aiming at improving one's performance ranking in a flat-wage environment. We find that average effort is higher when individuals are informed about their relative performance. However, ranking feedback also favors disreputable behavior. Some individuals do not hesitate to incur a cost to improve their rank by sabotaging others' work or by increasing artificially their own performance. Introducing sabotage opportunities has a strong detrimental effect on performance. Therefore, ranking incentives should be used with care. Inducing group identity discourages sabotage among peers but increases in-group rivalry. Data, as supplemental material, are available at http://dx.},

A cost-based evaluation of such services should depend on the total cost associated with the service-i.e., the price and the amount of time taken for completion. In this paper, we demonstrate that the characteristics of the path to the final destination also influence evaluation and choice. Specifically, we show that segments of idle time and travel away from the final destination are seen as obstacles in the progress towards the destination, and hence lower the choice likelihood of the path. Further, we show that the earlier such obstacles occur during the service, the lower is the choice likelihood. We present an analytical model of consumer choice and test its predictions in a series of experiments. Our results show that in choosing between two services that cover the same displacement in the same time (i.e., identical average progress), consumer choice is driven by the perception of progress towards the goal (i.e., by virtual progress). In a final experiment, we show that the effects of virtual progress may outweigh the effects of actual average progress.},

abstract = {A previous literature cautions that paying workers for performance might crowd out nonmonetary motives to work hard. Empirical evidence from the field, however, has been based on between-subjects designs that are best suited for detecting crowding out due to low-powered incentives. High-powered incentives in the workplace tend to increase output, but it is unknown whether this masks crowding out. This paper uses a within-subject experimental design and finds evidence that crowding out also extends to high-powered incentives in a real work setting with paid workers. There is individual heterogeneity, however, with a minority of workers reporting crowding in of motivation. Thus, the impact of performance pay might depend on the mix of worker types.

abstract = {Vaccination is one of the great achievements of the 20th century, yet persistent public-health problems include inadequate, delayed, and unstable vaccination uptake. Psychology offers three general propositions for understanding and intervening to increase uptake where vaccines are available and affordable. The first proposition is that thoughts and feelings can motivate getting vaccinated. Hundreds of studies have shown that risk beliefs and anticipated regret about infectious disease correlate reliably with getting vaccinated; low confidence in vaccine effectiveness and concern about safety correlate reliably with not getting vaccinated. We were surprised to find that few randomized trials have successfully changed what people think and feel about vaccines, and those few that succeeded were minimally effective in increasing uptake. The second proposition is that social processes can motivate getting vaccinated. Substantial research has shown that social norms are associated with vaccination, but few int...},

In each experiment, Ss performed an activity during 3 different periods, and observations relevant to their motivation were made. External rewards were given to the experimental Ss during the 2nd period only, while the control Ss received no rewards. Results indicate that (a) when money was used as an external reward, intrinsic motivation tended to decrease; whereas (b) when verbal reinforcement and positive feedback were used, intrinsic motivation tended to increase. Discrepant findings in the literature are reconciled using a new theoretical framework which employs a cognitive approach and concentrates on the nature of the external reward. (26 ref.)

abstract = {Hospital emergency departments (EDs) provide around-the-clock medical care, and as such are generally modeled as nonterminating queues. However, from the care provider's point of view, ED care is not a never-ending process, but rather occurs in discrete work shifts and may require passing unfinished work to the next care provider at the end of the shift. We use data from a large, academic medical center ED to show that the patients' rate of service completion varies over the course of the physician shift. Further, patients that have experienced a physician handoff have a higher rate of service completion than non-handed off patients. As a result, a patient's expected treatment time is impacted by when in the physician's shift treatment begins. We also show that patients that have been handed off are more likely to revisit the ED within three days, suggesting that patient handoffs lower clinical quality. Lastly, we use simulation to show that shift length and new-patient cutoff rules can be used to reduce handoffs, but at the expense of system throughput.},

@article{Gopal2013,
abstract = {P roduct launch-an event when a new product debuts for production in a plant-is an important phase in product development. But launches disrupt manufacturing operations, resulting in productivity losses. Using data from North American automotive plants from years 1999-2007, we estimate that a product launch entails an average productivity loss of 12\%-15\% at the plant level. This translates to a monetary loss of 42-53 million per launch in lost productivity. We identify several ways to mitigate the decrease in productivity. Product (or mix) flexibility in the body shop is critical for reducing the productivity loss. A plant's past experiences with product launches as well as with manufacturing similar products (specifically, on the same platform as the launch product) temper the productivity losses even further. Nevertheless, there are subtle differences in the accrued learning with these two types of experiences: whereas the positive impact of platform experience persists over time, the learning accrued with launching other products in the same plant decays more quickly. Altogether, our results suggest that launching products at a flexible plant with appropriate platform experience could recover approximately 31 million per launch in lost productivity.},

Findings from a panel data set of U.S.-based pharmaceutical plants over a 13-year period reveal that colocation of manufacturing and R\&D relates to better conformance quality, on average, across the entire sample. We find that these benefits of colocation persist throughout the time period we study (1994-2007), which is surprising, given the rapid development of information and communication technologies during that time. These benefits are particularly enhanced for manufacturing plants operating with processes that involve a high level of tacit process knowledge and that belong to large firms. Our findings highlight the importance of matching organizational design with process and firm characteristics in settings involving knowledge interdependence. They also highlight the continued value of physical proximity through geographical colocation between manufacturing and R\&D activities to achieve desired quality outcomes.},

abstract = {The design and use of standard processes are foundational recommendations in many operations practices. Yet, given the demonstrated performance benefits of standardized processes, it is surprising that they are often not followed consistently. One way to ensure greater compliance is by electronically monitoring the activities of individuals, although such aggressive monitoring poses the risk of inducing backlash. In the setting of hand hygiene in healthcare, a context where compliance with standard processes is frequently less than 50\% and where this lack of compliance can result in negative consequences, we investigated the effectiveness of electronic monitoring. We did so using a unique, radio frequency identification (RFID)-based system deployed in 71 hospital units. We found that electronically monitoring individual compliance resulted in a large, positive increase in compliance. We also found that there was substantial variability in the effect across units and that units with higher levels of preactivation compliance experienced increased benefits from monitoring relative to units with lower levels of prepreactivation compliance. By observing compliance rates over three and a half years, we investigated the persistent effects of individual monitoring and found that compliance rates initially increased before they gradually declined. Additionally, in multiple units, individual monitoring was discontinued, allowing for an investigation of the impact of removing the intervention on compliance. Surprisingly, we found that, after removal, compliance rates declined to below prepreactivation levels. Our findings suggest that, although individual electronic monitoring can dramatically improve process compliance, it requires sustained managerial commitment.

abstract = {Sustaining operational productivity in the completion of repetitive tasks is critical to many organizations' success. Yet research points to two different work-design–related strategies for accomplishing this goal: specialization to capture the benefits of repetition and variety (i.e., working on different tasks) to keep workers motivated and provide them opportunities to learn. In this paper, we investigate how these two strategies may bring different productivity benefits over time. For our empirical analyses, we use two and a half years of transaction data from a Japanese bank's home loan application-processing line. We find that over the course of a single day, specialization, as compared to variety, is related to improved worker productivity. However, when we examine workers' experience across a number of days, we find that variety helps improve worker productivity. Additionally, we show that part of this benefit results from workers' cumulative experience with changeovers. Our results highlight the need for organizations to transform specialization and variety into mutually reinforcing strategies rather than treating them as mutually exclusive. Overall, our paper identifies new ways to improve operational performance through the effective allocation of work.\nThis paper was accepted by Christian Terwiesch, operations management.},

Operations is the function that is uniquely associated with the design and management of these processes. The problem domains of concern to the department have been, and remain, the marshalling of inputs, the transformation itself, and the distribution of outputs in pursuit of this value-creating end. Over the past 50 years the department has had a variety of titles, reflecting an evolving understanding of the boundaries of the operations function.
