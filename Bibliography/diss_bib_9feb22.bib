abstract = {The two observations that (1) some low-income citizens demand low redistribution and (2) as income inequality becomes more severe a larger proportion of citizens make less demand for redistribution (Kelly and Enns (2010)) are counter-intuitive because people oppose redistribution that could be beneficial to them. Understanding the main driving factor that leads to the economic conservatism of the poor is crucial: it guides how policymakers should design redistribution. I show that po-sitional concern can be one of these main factors. When citizens care about their relative position on consumption and their labor productivity is slightly perturbed when a new tax policy is implemented, only middle-income citizens may vote for redistribution. Compared with the prospect of upward mobility hypothesis, I provide a testable prediction for the relationship between economic inequality and the economic conservatism of the poor. If positional concern is the main driving factor, policymakers should focus on increasing the low-income citizens' standard of living to the middle class; and if the prospect of upward mobility is the main factor then they should focus on minimizing income gaps.},

abstract = {Health policy xxx (xxxx) xxx a b s t r a c t Best practices in team-based incentive design remain underexplored. This study examines under group-based pay-for-performance, how managers incentivize physicians for teamwork through internal feedback and payment distribution methods. In collaboration with Taiwan Association of Family Medicine, authors conducted a national survey of physician groups, with a response rate of 48.3\%. Multilevel linear regression was applied to 134 groups, collectively consisting of 1,245 physicians in Taiwan. The outcome variables were two manager-rated scores for group performance on achieving (a) comprehensive, coordinated , continuous care, and (b) patient health improvement. The results indicate that providing each physician feedback on peer performance is superior to not providing it; when providing peer information within a group, concealing identities is superior to revealing them. These findings imply that application of the principle of social comparison can be effective; however, caution should be taken when disclosure of identifiable peer performance may intensify peer competition and undermine care coordination in team-based models. Further, groups that distribute payments equally among physicians perform better than groups that distributed payment proportionally to physicians' patient shares. The findings are ger-mane to small teams, where physicians do not have full control over care processes and outcomes, and need to work cooperatively to maximize group-based payment.},

INFORMS provides unique networking and learning opportunities for individual professionals, and organizations of all types and sizes, to better understand and use O.R. and analytics tools and methods to transform strategic visions and achieve better outcomes. For more information on INFORMS, its publications, membership, or meetings visit Abstract. Frequently, policy makers seek to roll out an intervention previously proven effective in a research study, perhaps subject to resource constraints. However, because different subpopulations may respond differently to the same treatment, there is no a priori guarantee that the intervention will be as effective in the targeted population as it was in the study. How then should policy makers target individuals to maximize intervention effectiveness? We propose a novel robust optimization approach that leverages evidence typically available in a published study. Our model can be easily optimized in minutes for realistic instances with off-the-shelf software and is flexible enough to accommodate a variety of resource and fairness constraints. We compare our approach with current practice by proving performance guarantees for both approaches, which emphasize their structural differences. We also prove an intuitive interpretation of our model in terms of regularization, penalizing differences in the demographic distribution between targeted individuals and the study population. Although the precise penalty depends on the choice of uncertainty set, we show that for special cases we can recover classical penalties from the covariate matching literature on causal inference. Finally, using real data from a large teaching hospital, we compare our approach to common practice in the particular context of reducing emergency department utilization by Medicaid patients through case management. We find that our approach can offer significant benefits over common practice, particularly when the heterogeneity in patient response to the treatment is large.

abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of identifying network effects in contagion processes and present an application to the propagation of influenza in the United States. In particular, using data on the evolution of infections over time, the travel intensity between states as well as environmental conditions we first provide a framework to identify the true network effect of traveling between states. Any identification strategy in this context needs to handle the following challenges: the reflection problem and the time correlation problem. The reflection problem arises from the observation that when sampling from the contagion process is frequent (in our case, weekly), the (potential) endogenous network effect cannot be discriminated from the correlation effect (such as that due to similar environmental conditions). The time-correlation effect stems from the observation that contagion processes are naturally characterized by correlation across different lags. We propose an instrumental variable approach, based on a spatiotemporally lagged versions of the observed data, and we show that our approach effectively tackles the aforementioned issues both theoretically and through a series of robustness checks. Finally, we use our estimates to propose and evaluate the performance of intervention and control policies, illustrating the benefits of network-based interventions.},

Working with observational data poses an important econometric challenge: as mentioned above, realized patient flow is endogenous to the congestion level in the hospital. To address the endogeneity issue, we use the instrumental variable approach where we construct instruments by exploiting the variation in the network structure (Bramoulle et al. 2009, Drakopoulos and Zheng 2017). Using counterfactual analyses, we show how our estimation results can be used to identify the bottleneck unit—the unit that has the biggest impact on system performance when its utilization is changed—and draw insights on how unit characteristics can help identify the bottleneck unit.},

However, causal inference poses many challenges in DID designs. In this article, we review key features of DID designs with an emphasis on public health policy research. Contemporary researchers should take an active approach to the design of DID studies, seeking to construct comparison groups, sensitivity analyses, and robustness checks that help validate the method's assumptions. We explain the key assumptions of the design and discuss analytic tactics, supplementary analysis, and approaches to statistical inference that are often important in applied research. The DID design is not a perfect substitute for randomized experiments, but it often represents a feasible way to learn about casual relationships. We conclude by noting that combining elements from multiple quasi-experimental techniques may be important in the next wave of innovations to the DID approach.},

However, when leaders assign tasks to team members, performance is usually not the only consideration. Favouritism, employees' seniority, employees' preferences over tasks, and fairness considerations often play a role as well. Team incentives have the potential to curtail the role of these factors in favor of performance — in particular when the incentive plan includes both the leader and the team members. This paper presents the results of a field experiment designed to study the effects of such team incentives on task assignment and performance. We introduce team incentives in a random subsets of 108 stores of a Dutch retail chain. We find no effect of the incentive, neither on task assignment nor on performance.},

abstract = {Matching estimators for average treatment effects are widely used in evaluation research despite the fact that their large sample properties have not been established in many cases. The absence of formal results in this area may be partly due to the fact that standard asymptotic expansions do not apply to matching estimators with a fixed number of matches because such estimators are highly nonsmooth functionals of the data. In this article we develop new methods for analyzing the large sample properties of matching estimators and establish a number of new results. We focus on matching with replacement with a fixed number of matches. First, we show that matching estimators are not N1/2-consistent in general and describe conditions under which matching estimators do attain N1/2-consistency. Second, we show that even in settings where matching estimators are N1/2-consistent, simple matching estimators with a fixed number of matches do not attain the semiparametric efficiency bound. Third, we provide a consistent estimator for the large sample variance that does not require consistent nonparametric estimation of unknown functions. Software for implementing these methods is available in Matlab, Stata, and R.},

abstract = {Propensity score matching (PSM) has become a popular approach to estimate causal treatment effects. It is widely applied when evaluating labour market policies, but empirical examples can be found in very diverse fields of study. Once the researcher has decided to use PSM, he is confronted with a lot of questions regarding its implementation. To begin with, a first decision has to be made concerning the estimation of the propensity score. Following that one has to decide which matching algorithm to choose and determine the region of common support. Subsequently, the matching quality has to be assessed and treatment effects and their standard errors have to be estimated. Furthermore, questions like 'what to do if there is choice-based sampling?' or 'when to measure effects?' can be important in empirical studies. Finally, one might also want to test the sensitivity of estimated treatment effects with respect to unobserved heterogeneity or failure of the common support condition. Each implementation step involves a lot of decisions and different approaches can be thought of. The aim of this paper is to discuss these implementation issues and give some guidance to researchers who want to use PSM for evaluation purposes. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are increasingly popular in the social sciences, not only in medicine. We argue that the lay public, and sometimes researchers, put too much trust in RCTs over other methods of investigation. Contrary to frequent claims in the applied literature, randomization does not equalize everything other than the treatment in the treatment and control groups, it does not automatically deliver a precise estimate of the average treatment effect (ATE), and it does not relieve us of the need to think about (observed or un-observed) covariates. Finding out whether an estimate was generated by chance is more difficult than commonly believed. At best, an RCT yields an unbiased estimate, but this property is of limited practical value. Even then, estimates apply only to the sample selected for the trial, often no more than a convenience sample, and justification is required to extend the results to other groups, including any population to which the trial sample belongs, or to any individual, including an individual in the trial. Demanding 'external validity' is unhelpful because it expects too much of an RCT while undervaluing its potential contribution. RCTs do indeed require minimal assumptions and can operate with little prior knowledge. This is an advantage when persuading dis-trustful audiences, but it is a disadvantage for cumulative scientific progress, where prior knowledge should be built upon, not discarded. RCTs can play a role in building scientific knowledge and useful predictions but they can only do so as part of a cumulative program, combining with other methods, including conceptual and theoretical development, to discover not 'what works', but 'why things work'.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine whether education, feedback, and provider prompts decrease the rate of missed vaccine opportunities; and the reasons for missed opportunities in the post-intervention group. A nonrandomized, before and after study to evaluate the effect of education, feedback, and provider prompts on missed opportunities was conducted in an inner-city community health center with a predominantly hispanic population. Vaccine opportunities were defined as visits of children 36 months or younger who were vaccination-eligible by ACIP guidelines. Consecutive sampling was used to identify two groups of children with vaccine opportunities: pre-and post-intervention. Feedback was given to vaccine providers on the frequency of missed opportunities in the pre-intervention group. The ACIP recommended vaccine schedule and true vaccine contraindications were reviewed. Nursing personnel were taught to identify and tag charts of children with vaccine opportunities. Physicians were asked to record vaccination status and the reason any vaccination was deferred. Missed opportunities decreased significantly, from 49\% (173/352) to 13\% (45/344), after the interventions (p < 0.001). The reasons for the 45 missed opportunities in the post-intervention sample were parent refusal (15.6\%), moderate or severe illness (15.6\%), and incorrect documentation as "up-to-date" (13.3\%). In 28.9\% there was a missed opportunity for simultaneous immunization. No reasons were documented for the remaining missed opportunity visits (26.6\%). The interventions, which emphasized improving provider knowledge of vaccinations and screening vaccine status at each visit, effectively decreased missed opportunities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Standing order programs (SOPs) allowing nonphysician personnel to assess patients' immunization status and administer vaccines without an individual physician order are a proven method of increasing adult vaccinations, yet they are underutilized by primary care physicians. METHODS: In a before-and-after trial, a pilot-tested and revised SOP toolkit (4 Pillars Toolkit) was implemented in four diverse primary care practices. Changes in influenza and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) vaccination rates were measured. The toolkit was evaluated using direct observation, group interviews, and surveys of each practice's staff. RESULTS: Use of the 4 Pillars Toolkit varied across sites. PPSV rates increased significantly overall for high-risk adults (18-64 years; 25\% in 2010-2011 vs. 40\% in 2011-2012, p = .02) but not for older adults (≥65 years; 44\% vs. 52\%, p = .26) and in two of four practices among both high-risk and older adults (p < .05). Influenza vaccination rates increased significantly in three of four sites and overall (22\% in 2010-2011 vs. 33\% in 2011-2012, overall; p < .001). Practices more fully implementing the toolkit demonstrated larger increases in vaccination rates. CONCLUSIONS: The 4 Pillars Toolkit is a promising means of improving primary care practice across diverse settings, with better results observed when strategies were maximally utilized.},

Study Design: Post hoc analysis of data from a randomized controlled cluster trial. Methods: Eighteen primary care practices received staff education, guidance for using the 4 Pillars™ Program and support of a practice immunization champion. Paired t-tests were used to compare vaccination rates were compared separately for those with diabetes, chronic lung or chronic heart disease or other high-risk conditions. Student's t-tests were used to compare across high-risk conditions. Generalized estimating equation modeling was used to determine likelihood of vaccination. Results: Based on ICD9 codes, 4,737 patients 18-64 years old were identified as having diabetes (n=1,999), chronic heart disease (n=658), chronic lung disease (n=1,682) or another high-risk condition (n=764). PPSV vaccination increased 12.2 percentage points (PP), Tdap vaccination increased 11.4 PP and influenza vaccination increased 4.8 PP. In regression analyses, patients with diabetes (OR=2.2, 95\%CI=1.80-2.73), chronic lung disease (OR=1.50, 95\% CI=1.21-1.87) or chronic heart disease (OR=1.32, 95\% CI=1.02-1.71) were more likely to receive PPSV than those without the respective high-risk condition. Those with diabetes (OR=1.14, 95\% CI=1.01-1.28) or chronic lung disease (OR=1.14, 95\% CI=1.01-1.30) were more likely to receive influenza vaccination than those without the respective condition.; likelihood of Tdap vaccination was not significantly associated with any of the chronic conditions tested. Conclusions: An intervention including the 4 Pillars™ Program was associated with significant increases in vaccination of high-risk adults. Overall uptake of recommended vaccines for those with high-risk conditions remained below national goals.},

abstract = {Purpose-To increase childhood influenza vaccination rates using a toolkit and early vaccine delivery in a randomized cluster trial. Methods-Twenty primary care practices treating children (range for n=536-8,183) were randomly assigned to Intervention and Control arms to test the effectiveness of an evidence-based practice improvement toolkit (4 Pillars Toolkit) and early vaccine supplies for use among disadvantaged children on influenza vaccination rates among children 6 months-18 years. Follow-up staff meetings and surveys were used to assess use and acceptability of the intervention strategies in the Intervention arm. Rates for the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 influenza seasons were compared. Two-level generalized linear mixed modeling was used to evaluate outcomes. Results-Overall increases in influenza vaccination rates were significantly greater in the Intervention arm (7.9 percentage points) compared with the Control arm (4.4 percentage points; P<0.034). These rate changes represent 4522 additional doses in the Intervention arm vs. 1,390 additional doses in the Control arm. This effect of the intervention was observed despite the fact that rates increased significantly in both arms-8/10 Intervention (P<0.001) and 7/10 Control sites (P-values 0.04 to <0.001). Rates in two Intervention sites with pre-intervention vaccination rates >58\% did not significantly increase. In regression analyses, a child's likelihood of being vaccinated was significantly higher with: younger age, white race (Odds ratio [OR]=1.29; 95\% confidence interval [CI]=1.23-1.34), having commercial insurance (OR=1.30; 95\%CI=1.25-1.35), higher pre-intervention practice vaccination rate (OR=1.25; 95\%CI=1.16-1.34), and being in the Intervention arm (OR=1.23; 95\%CI=1.01-1.50). Early delivery of influenza vaccine was rated by Intervention practices as an effective strategy for raising rates. Conclusions-Implementation of a multi-strategy toolkit and early vaccine supplies can significantly improve influenza vaccination rates among children in primary care practices but the effect may be less pronounced in practices with moderate to high existing vaccination rates.},

abstract = {Background: Although provider feedback and recall/reminder systems have been shown to increase vaccination rates for children, little is known about the effectiveness of less intensive interventions. Objective: To determine whether provider prompting at acute care visits in an urban hospital-based outpatient clinic can increase vaccination rates and decrease missed opportunities. Design and Methods: Study participants, 3 years or younger, were identified from a managed care organization as receiving primary care at the clinic. Eligibility criteria included 1 or more visits to the clinic without regard to continuity of enrollment. Patients vaccination records were generated at nursing triage and attached to the encounter sheet. Vaccination and visit data were abstracted from medical records, and comparisons were made between baseline (n=521) and postintervention (n=642) groups for up-to-date vaccination rates, missed opportunity rates, and mean numbers of visits. Results: Up-to-date rates at the age of 24 months for 4 diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis, 3 polio, 1 measles-mumps-rubella, 3 hepatitis B, and 3 Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines changed from 70\% to 78\% (P=.07). Up-to-date rates increased significantly to 87\% among the subset of children continuously enrolled in the managed care organization and the practice (P<.01). Overall, mean numbers of visits were similar. Missed opportunity rates among children not up-to-date for 4 diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis, 3 polio, 1 measles-mumps-rubella, 3 hepatitis B, and 3 Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines at the age of 24 months declined from 65\% to 45\% (P=.04). Similar trends were noted at the age of 10 months. Conclusions: In the absence of increased funding, minor changes in standard operating procedures may improve vaccination delivery. Further improvements may require efforts to ensure continuity of provider and plan assignment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: At child health visits, immunizations that are due are frequently not given. Increased parent understanding of and demand for immunizations may influence providers to not miss these opportunities. OBJECTIVE: To assess, as part of a larger study of effectiveness of parent education and case management (CM) in raising immunization rates, the intervention's effectiveness at reducing missed opportunities to vaccinate during child health visits. METHODS: A representative sample of African American newborns and their families from south central Los Angeles, Calif, were randomly assigned to a control or a CM group and observed during the first year of life. Case managers visited and telephoned parents, educating them on the benefits and safety of immunizations, and encouraging them to request immunizations from providers. When the children were at least 1 year of age, parents were interviewed and provider records were abstracted. RESULTS: Complete records were abstracted for 126 controls and 129 CM group children. For these children, 1092 visits were documented where immunizations were due. Missed opportunities to vaccinate occurred at more than 50\% of visits. Case management was associated with a modest reduction in the percentage of visits with missed opportunities in the bivariate analysis but not after adjustment for other covariates. In a logistic regression model, missed opportunities were more frequent at visits with private than public physicians and at acute illness than well-child visits. Missed opportunities were less frequent among children with a history of at least 1 cancelled appointment, and for visits of children with mothers who smoked. CONCLUSIONS: Missed opportunities were minimally influenced by a home visitation and parent education program. They are primarily determined by issues under the control of the provider. Family- and child-related characteristics, however, do influence the likelihood of a missed opportunity occurring independent of provider factors.},

Nine primary care sites serving impoverished and middle-class children. Subjects. Complete birth cohorts (ages 0 to 12 months; n 3015) from these sites. Interventions. Two 18-month duration interventions: 1) tracking with outreach [tracking/outreach] to bring underimmunized children to their primary care provider office, and 2) a primary care provider office policy change to identify and reduce missed immunization opportunities (prompting). Design. Randomized, controlled trial, randomizing within sites using a two-by-two factorial design. Subjects were allocated to one of four study groups: control, prompting only, tracking/outreach only, and combined prompting with tracking/outreach. Outcomes were obtained by blinded chart abstraction. Measures. Immunization status for age; number of days of delay in immunization; primary care utilization; and rates of screening for occult disease. Results. Out of 3015 subjects, 274 subjects (9\%) transferred out of the participating sites or had incomplete charts and were excluded. The 2741 (91\%) remaining subjects were assessed. At baseline, study groups did not differ in age, gender, insurance type, or immunization status. Of the remaining subjects, 63\% received Medic-aid.

Analysis of variance showed that: 1) tracking/outreach increased immunization rates 20 percentage points; 2) tracking/outreach decreased mean immunization delay 63 days; 3) tracking/outreach increased mean health supervision visits 0.44 visits per child; 4) tracking/outreach increased mean anemia screening 0.17 screenings per child and mean lead screenings 0.12 screenings per child; 5) impact of tracking/outreach was greatest for uninsured and impoverished patients; and 6) the prompting intervention had no impact on the studied outcomes, and its failure was caused by inconsistent use of prompts and failure to vaccinate ill children when prompted. Using tracking/outreach, the cost per additional child fully immunized was 474. Each 1000 spent on the track-ing/outreach intervention resulted in: 2.1 additional fully vaccinated children and 668 fewer child-days of delayed immunization; 4.6 additional health supervision visits and 5.9 additional other visits to the primary care provider ; and 1.8 additional anemia screenings and 1.3 additional lead screenings. Conclusions. Outreach directed toward children not up-to-date on immunizations improves not only immunization status, but also health supervision visit attendance and screening rates. The cost per additional child immunized was high, but should be interpreted in view of the spillover benefits that accompanied improved immunization. Effective means to improve coverage by reducing missed immunization opportunities still need to be identified.

abstract = {Background: Missed opportunities for vaccination (MOVs) occur when persons eligible for vaccination visit a health facility and do not get the vaccines they need. We conducted a systematic review to assess effects of interventions for reducing MOVs. Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in April 2017. Three authors independently screened search outputs, reviewed potentially eligible papers, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data; resolving disagreements by consensus. We expressed study results as risk ratios (RR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool. Results: Six studies (five trials and one cohort study) met our inclusion criteria, all conducted in the United States of America. All six studies had various limitations and were classified as having a high risk of bias. We found moderate certainty evidence that the following interventions probably improve vaccination coverage: patient education (RR 1.92, 95\% CI 1.38-2.68), patient tracking using community health workers (RR 1.18, 95\% CI 1.11-1.25), and patient tracking and provider prompts (RR 1.24, 95\% CI 1.18-1.31). In addition, we found low certainty evidence that concurrent interventions targeting health-facility (education, prompts, and audit and feedback) and family settings (phone calls) may increase vaccination coverage (RR 1.25, 95\% CI 1.08-1.46). Conclusions: The currently available evidence suggests that patient education, patient tracking, outreach sessions, and provider prompts reduce missed opportunities for vaccination and improve vaccination coverage. Rigorous studies are required to confirm these findings and increase the certainty of the current evidence base. WHO is currently coordinating efforts to generate such evidence, especially from low-income and middle-income countries, and it is likely that the data will be available in the next few years.},

abstract = {Many psychological theories predict U-shaped relationships: The effect of x is positive for low values of x, but negative for high values, or vice versa. Despite implying merely a change of sign, hypotheses about U-shaped functions are tested almost exclusively via quadratic regressions, an approach that imposes an arbitrary functional-form assumption that in some scenarios can lead to a 100\% rate of false positives (e.g., the incorrect conclusion that y = log( x) is U shaped). Estimating two regression lines, one for low and one for high values of x, allows testing for a sign change without a functional-form assumption. I introduce the Robin Hood algorithm as a way to set the break point between the lines. This algorithm delivers higher power to detect U shapes than all the other break-point-setting alternatives I compared with it. The article includes simulations demonstrating the performance of the two-lines test and reanalyses of published results using this test.

abstract = {We present evidence from a firm level experiment in which we engineered an exogenous change in managerial compensation from fixed wages to performance pay based on the average productivity of lower-tier workers. Theory suggests that managerial incentives affect both the mean and dispersion of workers' productivity through two channels. First, managers respond to incentives by targeting their efforts towards more able workers, implying that both the mean and the dispersion increase. Second, managers select out the least able workers, implying that the mean increases but the dispersion may decrease. In our field experiment we find that the introduction of managerial performance pay raises both the mean and dispersion of worker productivity. Analysis of individual level productivity data shows that managers target their effort towards high ability workers, and the least able workers are less likely to be selected into employment. These results highlight the interplay between the provision of managerial incentives and earnings inequality among lower-tier workers.},

abstract = {Background: Current multivalent influenza vaccine products provide protection against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B lineage viruses. The 2018–2019 influenza season in the US included prolonged circulation of both A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses well-matched to the vaccine strain, and A(H3N2) viruses the majority of which were mismatched to the vaccine. We estimate the number of vaccineprevented influenza-associated illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths for the season. Methods: We used a mathematical model and Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate numbers and 95\% uncertainty intervals (UI) of influenza-associated outcomes prevented by vaccination in the US. The model incorporated age-specific estimates of national 2018–2019 influenza vaccine coverage, influenza virus-specific vaccine effectiveness from the US Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network, and disease burden estimated from population-based rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network. Results: Influenza vaccination prevented an estimated 4.4 million (95\% UI: 3.4 million–7.1 million) illnesses, 2.3 million (95\% UI: 1.8 million–3.8 million) medical visits, 58,000 (95\% UI: 30,000–156,000) hospitalizations, and 3,500 (95\% UI: 1,000–13,000) deaths due to influenza viruses during the US 2018– 2019 influenza season. Vaccination prevented 14\% of projected hospitalizations associated with A(H1N1)pdm09 overall and 43\% among young children aged 6 months–4 years. Conclusions: Influenza vaccination averted substantial influenza-associated disease including hospitalizations and deaths in the US, primarily due to effectiveness against A(H1N1)pdm09. Our findings underscore the value of influenza vaccination, highlighting that vaccines measurably decrease illness and associated health care utilization even in a season in which a vaccine component does not match to a circulating virus.},

Furthermore, great strategies focus attention on creating value for the customer—through the firm's value proposition and business model—relative to capturing value for the shareholders. Finally, we propose that great strategies emerge from a focused, strategic agenda communicated and distributed throughout the organization. We illustrate our propositions by compar- ing Apple and Motorola, which began with similar ideas for developing a strategy for seamless integration and seamless mobility, with smartphones as the digital hub.

We sought to determine the amount of time required for a primary care physician to provide recommended preventive services to an average patient panel. Methods. We used published and estimated times per service to determine the physician time required to provide all services recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), at the recommended frequency, to a patient panel of 2500 with an age and sex distribution similar to that of the US population. Results. To fully satisfy the USPSTF recommendations, 1773 hours of a physician's annual time, or 7.4 hours per working day, is needed for the provision of preventive services. Conclusions. Time constraints limit the ability of physicians to comply with preventive services recommendations. (Am J Public Health. 2003;93:635-641) national agencies (e.g., the American Cancer Society) have created their own guidelines, increasing the number of screening tests to be considered. Given competing financial demands to see a greater number of patients while providing increasing levels of preventive services, it is worth examining whether providing the recommended preventive services for the patients in a practice can be reasonably accomplished. Delivery of preventive services obviously consumes physician time, but no study has estimated how much time is required to provide each service or, more importantly, the time needed to deliver these services to all patients in a practice. In this study we examined the following questions: To fully achieve current recommendations for the provision of preventive services, how much time would be required for a practicing physician to provide the recommended services to all patients? What percentage of the physician's available work hours would need to be spent delivering these services? METHODS To calculate the total time necessary to provide preventive services to a population, we considered 4 elements: (1) a list of recommended services, (2) the frequency of performing each service, (3) the number of people requiring each service, and (4) the time required to administer each service. The product of these 4 factors was compared with},

Physician time constraints in primary care are likely one cause. METHODS We applied guideline recommendations for 10 common chronic diseases to a panel of 2,500 primary care patients with an age-sex distribution and chronic disease prevalences similar to those of the general population, and estimated the minimum physician time required to deliver high-quality care for these conditions. The result was compared with time available for patient care for the average primary care physician. RESULTS Eight hundred twenty-eight hours per year, or 3.5 hours a day, were required to provide care for the top 10 chronic diseases, provided the disease is stable and in good control. We recalculated this estimate based on increased time requirements for uncontrolled disease. Estimated time required increased by a factor of 3. Applying this factor to all 10 diseases, time demands increased to 2,484 hours, or 10.6 hours a day. CONCLUSIONS Current practice guidelines for only 10 chronic illnesses require more time than primary care physicians have available for patient care overall. Streamlined guidelines and alternative methods of service delivery are needed to meet recommended standards for quality health care.},

This paper disentangles the effects of demotivation, social conformity, and status associated with ranking. I implement a randomized experiment at a Bangladeshi sweater factory that pays employees on piece rates. Treated workers receive monthly information on their relative performance either in private or in public. A simple theoretical framework shows that intrinsic status concerns induce Private Treatment workers to increase or decrease effort depending on the feedback they receive from the intervention. Workers in Public Treatment respond similarly but face two additional incentives-social status (positive effect) and social conformity (negative effect). Empirical evidence shows that Private Treatment workers increased (decreased) effort upon receiving positive (negative) feedback. Public ranking led to lower net effort relative to Private Treatment because of a strong preference not to outperform friends. The negative effects from demo-tivation and social conformity may explain why the existing literature finds mixed evidence of impact of ranking workers.},

A large US transportation company is in the process of {\ldots}tting its trucks with an electronic on-board recorder (EOBR), which provide drivers with information on their driving performance. In this setting, a natural question is whether the optimal managerial practice consists of: (1) Letting each driver know his or her individual performance only; or (2) Also providing drivers with information about their ranking with respect to other drivers. The company is also in the {\ldots}rst phase of a multi-year 'lean-management journey', which corresponds to an overhaul of the relational contract with its employees. This phase focuses exclusively on changing employee values, mainly toward a greater emphasis on teamwork and empowerment. The main result of our randomized experiment is that (2) leads to better performance than (1) in a particular site if and only if the site has not yet received the values intervention, and worse performance if it has. The result is consistent with the presence of a con ‡ict between competition-based managerial practices and a cooperation-based relational contract. More broadly, it highlights the role of intangible relational factors in We are particularly indebted to Rebecca Henderson who has provided extensive support and advice during this ongoing research program and of course to our partner company for their collaboration.

This paper studies the effect of providing feedback to college students on their position in the grade distribution by using a natural field experiment. This information was updated every six months during a three-year period. We find that greater grades transparency decreases educational performance, as measured by the number of examinations passed and grade point average (GPA). However, self-reported satisfaction, as measured by surveys conducted after feedback is provided but before students take their examinations, increases. We provide a theoretical framework to understand these results, focusing on the role of prior beliefs and using out-of-trial surveys to test the model. In the absence of treatment, a majority of students underestimate their position in the grade distribution, suggesting that the updated information is "good news" for many students. Moreover, the negative effect on performance is driven by those students who underestimate their position in the absence of feedback. Students who overestimate initially their position, if anything, respond positively. The performance effects are short lived-by the time students graduate, they have similar accumulated GPA and graduation rates.},

Our results show that the average performance of the subjects who are provided self-performance feedback is 11\% lower than the ones who obtain no feedback. Moreover, setting a non-binding personal goal does not affect performance. Finally, assigning an exogenous goal and providing relative performance feedback decreases performance by 8\%.

We found 90\% or greater agreement on the importance of 32 (58\%) statements. These statements, indicating issues considered to be of considerable importance (rated as important or very important), related to: computerised alerts; the need to avoid spurious alerts; making it difficult to override critical alerts; having audit trails of such overrides; support for safe repeat prescribing, effective computer-user interface; importance of call and recall management; and the need to be able to run safety reports.

abstract = {Many computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems have integrated drug safety alerts. The authors reviewed the literature on physician response to drug safety alerts and interpreted the results using Reason's framework of accident causation. In total, 17 papers met the inclusion criteria. Drug safety alerts are overridden by clinicians in 49\% to 96\% of cases. Alert overriding may often be justified and adverse drug events due to overridden alerts are not always preventable. A distinction between appropriate and useful alerts should be made. The alerting system may contain error-producing conditions like low specificity, low sensitivity, unclear information content, unnecessary workflow disruptions, and unsafe and inefficient handling. These may result in active failures of the physician, like ignoring alerts, misinterpretation, and incorrect handling. Efforts to improve patient safety by increasing correct handling of drug safety alerts should focus on the error-producing conditions in software and organization. Studies on cognitive processes playing a role in overriding drug safety alerts are lacking. j J Am Med Inform Assoc. 2006;13:138-147. DOI 10.1197/jamia.M1809. Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems frequently include integrated decision support components, which can reduce errors and improve patient safety. 1-6 Studies documenting positive effects of decision support on patient outcomes, including fewer duplicate orders, fewer overdoses, fewer allergic reactions, and reduced drug interactions , have prompted calls for additional safety-related, patient-specific advice. 1,3,5 Yet, the burden of reminders and alerts must not be too high, 1,2,6-8 or ''alert fatigue'' may cause clinicians to override both important and unimportant alerts, 2,9 in a manner that compromises the desired safety effect of integrating decision support into CPOE. This review attempts to provide insight into physicians' handling of safety alerts by asking the following questions: How often and in what situations are safety alerts overridden? Why do physicians override them? What effects ensue? What understanding of alert overrides can lead to improved alerting systems? The authors employ Reason's model of accident causation 10 to understand overriding and its effects and to suggest new directions to improve alerting. Methods The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from January 1980 to December 2004 were searched for English-language publications with the following MeSH headings and text words: computerized physician (medication) order entry, CPOE, electronic prescribing, computerized prescribing, medical record systems computerized and alert *, remind *, prompt *, order check, critic*, critiq*, decision support systems clinical, reminder systems, drug therapy computer assisted and over-rid *, medical error, adverse drug events, and attitude. The authors also checked literature references of three recent systematic reviews and one synthesis of review paper. 1,3,5,11 The authors selected publications discussing overriding of unsolicited drug safety alerts that appear during the prescription process because automatic provision of alerts has been proven to be a critical feature for changing clinician behavior. 12 The term computerized physician order entry is used because interpretation and handling of drug safety alerts requires medical expertise. Full articles were included, but also proceedings when pertinent. The references of these publications were checked also. The refined selection was used for the first part of this review. To learn how alerting could be improved, the authors examined all publications from the search for characteristics of unsolicited safety alerts as well as measures to minimize error-producing conditions. Results Seventeen publications on overriding safety alerts in CPOE were identified 2,13-28 (Table 1). Quantitative information on overriding was present in nine publications. 13-21 This small yield does not pose a problem because the review focuses mainly on the conceptual analysis of the determinants of overriding. For the second part of this article, we selected from 193 papers of the first search those that described characteristics of safety alerts.},

In this study, we develop a sample of US hospitals and use cardiac care as our context to empirically examine our questions. To measure a patient's resource usage, we use the total length of stay, which includes any additional inpatient stay necessitated by unplanned readmissions within thirty days after initial hospitalization. We find evidence that higher process quality, and more specifically its clinical (as opposed to its administrative) dimensions, are associated with a reduction in resource usage. Moreover, the standardization of care that is achieved via the implementation of medical guidelines, makes this effect more pronounced in less focused environments: higher process quality is more beneficial when the cardiac department's patient population is distributed across a wider range of medical conditions. We explore the implications of these findings for process-oriented pay-for-performance programs, which tie the reimbursement of hospitals to their adherence to evidence-based medical guidelines.},

Anecdotal evidence suggests that firms can achieve internal benefits such as quality or productivity improvements or that certification can help firms maintain or increase their market share, or both. Others argue that the standard is too generic to cause performance improvement but can be seen as a signal of good management. In this paper, we track financial performance from 1987 to 1997 of all publicly traded ISO 9000 certified manufacturing firms in the United States with SIC codes 2000-3999, and test whether ISO 9000 certification leads to productivity improvements, market benefits, and improved financial performance. We employ event-study methods, matching each certified firm to a control group of one or more noncertified firms in the same industry with similar precertification size and/or return on assets. We find that firms' decision to seek their first ISO 9000 certification was indeed followed by significant abnormal improvements in financial performance, though the exact timing and magnitude of this effect depend on the specification of the control group. Three years after certification, the certified firms do display strongly significant abnormal performance under all control-group specifications. The degree to which the precise results vary across control-group specifications indicates that event studies should always include extensive sensitivity analysis, for instance matching by size and performance separately and jointly, using both single firms and portfolios as controls.},

For more information on INFORMS, its publications, membership, or meetings visit T o investigate the opportunity for hospitals to achieve better care at lower cost, we examine two key process quality measures, conformance quality and experiential quality, and two measures of performance, readmis-sion rate and cost per discharge. Conformance quality represents a hospital's level of adherence to evidence-based standards of care, whereas experiential quality represents the level of interaction between hospital's caregivers and patients. Analyzing six years of data from 3,474 U.S. acute care hospitals, we find that combining conformance and experiential quality results in lower readmission rates. However, conformance quality and experiential quality each independently increase cost per discharge, which suggests that a readmissions-costs trade-off is unavoidable. To investigate this further, we conduct post hoc analyses by distinguishing between the granular elements of experiential quality (EQ) based on task type: response-focused EQ and communication-focused EQ. Response-focused EQ measures caregivers' ability to respond to patient's explicit needs, whereas communication-focused EQ measures caregivers' ability to engage in meaningful conversations with the patient. We find that combining communication-focused EQ with conformance quality reduces readmission rates. Moreover , as conformance quality increases, the cost of improving communication-focused EQ decreases, indicating complementarity. Response-focused EQ in combination with conformance quality also results in reduced read-mission rates. However, as conformance quality increases, the cost of improving response-focused EQ also increases, suggesting that these dimensions might compete for resources. Taken together, our results suggest that hospital administrators can mitigate the trade-off between reducing readmissions and controlling costs by prioritizing communication-focused EQ over response-focused EQ.},

abstract = {WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that health departments in all 50 states deliver AFIX (Assessment, Feedback, Incentives, and eXchange) consultations to 25\% of federally funded vaccine providers each year. AFIX effectively raises vaccination coverage among young children. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: AFIX consultations achieved short-term gains in coverage for 11-to 12-year-olds for vaccines in the adolescent platform. No gains occurred for older adolescents or over the long term. Consultations were equally effective when delivered in-person or by webinar. abstract OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of in-person and webinar-delivered AFIX (Assessment, Feedback, Incentives, and eXchange) consultations for increasing adolescent vaccine coverage. METHODS: We randomly assigned 91 primary care clinics in North Carolina, serving 107 443 adolescents, to receive no consultation or an in-person or webinar AFIX consultation. We delivered in-person consultations in April through May 2011 and webinar consultations in May through August 2011. The state' s immunization registry provided vaccine coverage data for younger patients (ages 11-12 years) and older patients (ages 13-18 years) for 3 adolescent vaccines: tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap); meningo-coccal; and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines (1 dose, females only). RESULTS: At the 5-month follow-up, AFIX consultations increased vaccine coverage among younger adolescents. Patients in the in-person arm experienced coverage changes that exceeded those in the control arm for Tdap (3.4\% [95\% confidence interval (CI): 2.2 to 4.6]), menin-gococcal (4.7\% [95\% CI: 2.3 to 7.2], and HPV (1.5\% [95\% CI: 0.3 to 2.7]) vaccines. Patients in the webinar versus control arm also experienced larger changes for these vaccines. AFIX did little to improve coverage among older adolescents. At 1 year, the 3 arms showed similar coverage changes. The effectiveness of in-person and webinar consultations was not statistically different at either time point (all, P ..05). CONCLUSIONS: Webinar AFIX consultations were as effective as in-person consultations in achieving short-term increases in vaccine coverage for younger adolescents. AFIX consultations for adolescents need improvement to have a stronger and more durable impact, especially for HPV vaccine.},

abstract = {We study the role of process friction in increasing efficiency of service provisions. We examine one potential lever for reducing the provision of discretionary services: "justification"-an otherwise non-value-added process step that introduces process friction by forcing workers to explain the rationale for requesting an optional service. We exploit the presence-and absence-of a justification step in the ultrasound (US) ordering process at two emergency departments (EDs). We find that patients with abdominal pain are less than half as likely to receive an US when there is a justification step compared to when there is not. Additionally, we find a spillover effect: other diagnostic tests are also ordered less frequently. The decrease in testing reduces the average length of stay of the patients, and reduces testing costs by more than 200,000, with no decrease in quality. We show that two mechanisms underlie these results: 1) justification reduces clinicians' available time, and 2) justification forces clinicians to reflect on a patient's need for service. Our paper contributes to recent theory on friction and reflection as drivers of efficiency in services. We show that justification can serve as an effective lever for reducing medical tests-and costs-without negatively impacting quality.},

EHR-based alerts have proved effective in improving vaccine delivery for routine pediatric vaccines but have not been thoroughly examined for influenza vaccine. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study is the first trial of EHR-based clinical alerts to improve influenza vaccine delivery in pediatric primary care. abstract OBJECTIVE: The goal was to assess the impact of influenza vaccine clinical alerts on missed opportunities for vaccination and on overall influenza immunization rates for children and adolescents with asthma. METHODS: A prospective, cluster-randomized trial of 20 primary care sites was conducted between October 1, 2006, and March 31, 2007. At intervention sites, electronic health record-based clinical alerts for influenza vaccine appeared at all office visits for children between 5 and 19 years of age with asthma who were due for vaccine. The proportion of captured immunization opportunities at visits and overall rates of complete vaccination for patients at intervention and control sites were compared with those for the previous year, after standardization for relevant covariates. The study had 80\% power to detect an 8\% difference in the change in rates between the study and baseline years at intervention versus control practices. RESULTS: A total of 23 418 visits and 11 919 children were included in the study year and 21 422 visits and 10 667 children in the previous year. The majority of children were male, 5 to 9 years of age, and privately insured. With standardization for selected covariates, captured vaccination opportunities increased from 14.4\% to 18.6\% at intervention sites and from 12.7\% to 16.3\% at control sites, a 0.6\% greater improvement. Standardized influenza vaccination rates improved 3.4\% more at intervention sites than at control sites. The 4 practices with the greatest increases in rates (11\%) were all in the intervention group. Vaccine receipt was more common among children who had been vaccinated previously, with increasing numbers of visits, with care early in the season, and at preventive versus acute care visits.

abstract = {Objective Adolescent immunization rates are suboptimal. Experts recommend provider prompts at health care visits to improve rates. We assessed the impact of either electronic health record (EHR) or nurse- or staff-initiated provider prompts on adolescent immunization rates. Methods We conducted a randomized controlled trial, allocating practices in 1 of 2 practice-based research networks (PBRN) to provider prompts or standard-of-care control. Ten primary care practices participated, 5 intervention and 5 controls, each matched in pairs on urban, suburban, or rural location and practice type (pediatric or family medicine), from a PBRN in Greater Rochester, New York (GR-PBRN); and 12 practices, 6 intervention, 6 controls, similarly matched, from a national pediatric continuity clinic PBRN (CORNET). The study period was 1 year per practice, ranging from June 2011 to January 2013. Study participants were adolescents 11 to 17 years attending these 22 practices; random sample of chart reviews per practice for baseline and postintervention year to assess immunization rates (n = 7,040 total chart reviews for adolescents with >1 visit in a period). The intervention was an EHR prompt (4 GR-PBRN and 5 CORNET practice pairs) (alert) that appeared on providers' computer screens at all office visits, indicating the specific immunizations that adolescents were recommended to receive. Staff prompts (1 GR-PBRN pair and 1 CORNET pair) in the form of a reminder sheet was placed on the provider's desk in the exam room indicating the vaccines due. We compared immunization rates, stratified by PBRN, for routine vaccines (meningococcus, pertussis, human papillomavirus, influenza) at study beginning and end. Results Intervention and control practices within each PBRN were similar at baseline for demographics and immunization rates. Immunization rates at the study end for adolescents who were behind on immunizations at study initiation were not significantly different for intervention versus control practices for any vaccine or combination of vaccines. Results were similar for each PBRN and also when only EHR-based prompts was assessed. For example, at study end, 3-dose human papillomavirus vaccination rates for GR-PBRN intervention versus control practices were 51\% versus 53\% (adjusted odds ratio 0.96; 95\% confidence interval 0.64-1.34); CORNET intervention versus control rates were 50\% versus 42\% (adjusted odds ratio 1.06; 95\% confidence interval 0.68-1.88). Conclusions and Relevance: In both a local and national setting, provider prompts failed to improve adolescent immunization rates. More rigorous practice-based changes are needed.},

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: We found that a clinician-focused intervention was most effective for initiating the HPV vaccine series, whereas a family-focused intervention supported completion. Decision support directed at both clinicians and families most effectively promotes HPV vaccine series receipt. abstract OBJECTIVE: To improve human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates, we studied the effectiveness of targeting automated decision support to families, clinicians, or both. METHODS: Twenty-two primary care practices were cluster-randomized to receive a 3-part clinician-focused intervention (education, electronic health record-based alerts, and audit and feedback) or none. Overall, 22 486 girls aged 11 to 17 years due for HPV vaccine dose 1, 2, or 3 were randomly assigned within each practice to receive family-focused decision support with educational telephone calls. Randomization established 4 groups: family-focused, clinician-focused, combined, and no intervention. We measured decision support effectiveness by final vaccination rates and time to vaccine receipt, standardized for covariates and limited to those having received the previous dose for HPV #2 and 3. The 1-year study began in May 2010. RESULTS: Final vaccination rates for HPV #1, 2, and 3 were 16\%, 65\%, and 63\% among controls. The combined intervention increased vaccination rates by 9, 8, and 13 percentage points, respectively. The control group achieved 15\% vaccination for HPV #1 and 50\% vaccination for HPV #2 and 3 after 318, 178, and 215 days. The combined intervention significantly accelerated vaccination by 151, 68, and 93 days.

We abstracted outcomes, methods, and results from each study and classified by type of intervention conducted. Findings from 34 studies suggest many types of intervention strategies can increase HPV vaccination coverage in different settings, and with modest cost.

We compared the initiation and completion of the HPV vaccine among women in 2 community-based networks with electronic health records: 1 with a prompt and reminder system (prompted cohort) and 1 without (unprompted cohort). Methods: Female patients aged 9 to 26 years seen between March 1, 2007, and January 25, 2010, were used as the retrospective cohort.

However, tournaments are less effective when participants have heterogeneous ability because participants may conclude that the ability gap is too large to be overcome by their effort. Our theoretical analysis shows that a similar loss of motivation arises when tournaments take place over multiple periods because interim performance acts in a way that is similar to heterogeneous ability. Analyzing the sales contests organized by a commodities company, we document that winning participants decrease their effort as their lead extends, whereas the effort of trailing participants fades only when the gap to a winning position is very large. We also show that, on average, when contests are introduced they induce a higher level of effort among participants, although the incentives weaken as the number of participants increases. Finally, we demonstrate that although retailers respond to the multiple performance dimensions of the incentive program in part by shifting effort toward sales of more expensive products, they channel most of the increased effort toward reaching more customers.},

Our work considers two forms of transparency: process transparency, in which customers receive information about the company's sustainability performance relative to other companies, and customer transparency, in which customers receive information about their own sustainability performance relative to other customers. Through three studies with 7,308 participants, we observe that revealing the levels of relative performance is more motivating for customers in the process transparency domain, whereas revealing relative changes in performance is more motivating for customers in the customer transparency domain. We employ structural equation modeling to identify the underlying mechanisms for these results. We show that levels information is more reflective of objective performance comparison, thus strengthening motivation in the domain of process transparency. In contrast, changes information helps to mitigate self-serving attribution biases in the customer transparency domain, thus playing a more significant role in affecting motivation.},

abstract = {Research summary: Exploiting opportunities is critical to a firm's competitive advantage. Not surprisingly, there has been considerable interest in the processes by which top managers allocate attention to potential opportunities. Although such investigations have largely focused on top-down processes for allocating attention to the environment, some studies have explored bottom-up processes. In this article, we consider both top-down and bottom-up processing to develop a model by which top managers form opportunity beliefs for strategic action depending on the allocation of transient and sustained attention. Specifically, this attentional model provides insights into how a top manager's attention is allocated to identify potential opportunities from environmental change and explores how different modes of attentional engagement impact the likelihood of forming beliefs about radical and incremental opportunities requiring strategic action. Managerial summary: Managers are interested in noticing and exploiting opportunities because the exploitation of an opportunity represents an important strategic action. Noticing and exploiting opportunities depends on how and where top managers allocate their attention. Managers can focus attention based on their knowledge and experience or as a result of something in the environment capturing their attention. In this paper, we consider both knowledge-driven and environment-driven processes for allocating attention to form opportunity beliefs. This opportunity belief arises from a two stage process. The first stage explains how a top manager identifies environmental changes as potential opportunities. The second stage explains how the top manager forms a belief that these identified environmental changes represent a radical or incremental opportunity worthy of exploitation},

@article{Kim2020,
abstract = {Providing patients timely care from the appropriate unit not only involves correct clinical evaluation of patient needs, but also requires making admission decisions to effectively manage a unit with limited capacity in the face of stochastic patient arrivals and length-of-stays. We study human decision behavior in this latter operations management task. Using behavioral models and controlled experiments in which physicians and MTurk workers manage a simulated hospital unit, we identify cognitive and environmental factors that drive systematic admission decision bias. We report on two main findings. First, seemingly innocuous "occupancy information hurdles" (operationalized by requiring typing a 10-character password to view current occupancy), causes a chain of events that leads physicians to maintain systematically lower utilization. Specifically, these hurdles cause physicians to make most admission decisions without checking the current unit occupancy. Then-between the times they check-physicians tend to believe there are fewer beds available than there are in reality because occupancy increases from admissions are more salient than occupancy decreases from discharges. Second, decision random error or "noise" leads to higher-or lower-than-optimal utilization of hospital units in a predictable pattern depending on the system parameters. We provide evidence that these patterns are due to some settings providing more "opportunities" for physicians to mistakenly admit too many patients, while other settings provide more opportunity to mistakenly reject too many patients. These two findings enhance our understanding of physician admission control decisions when capacity is limited and generate mitigation strategies for helping clinicians manage hospital unit capacity more efficiently.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Interventions based on behavioral science might reduce inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. OBJECTIVE: To assess effects of behavioral interventions and rates of inappropriate (not guideline-concordant) antibiotic prescribing during ambulatory visits for acute respiratory tract infections. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cluster randomized clinical trial conducted among 47 primary care practices in Boston and Los Angeles. Participants were 248 enrolled clinicians randomized to receive 0,1, 2, or 3 interventions for 18 months. All clinicians received education on antibiotic prescribing guidelines on enrollment. Interventions began between November 1,2011, and October 1,2012. Follow-up for the latest-starting sites ended on April 1, 2014. Adult patients with comorbidities and concomitant infections were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Three behavioral interventions, implemented alone or in combination: suggested alternatives presented electronic order sets suggesting nonantibiotic treatments; accountable justification prompted clinicians to enter free-text justifications for prescribing antibiotics into patients' electronic health records; peer comparison sent emails to clinicians that compared their antibiotic prescribing rates with those of "top performers" (those with the lowest inappropriate prescribing rates). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Antibiotic prescribing rates for visits with antibiotic-inappropriate diagnoses (nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections, acute bronchitis, and influenza) from 18 months preintervention to 18 months afterward, adjusting each intervention's effects for co-occurring interventions and preintervention trends, with random effects for practices and clinicians. RESULTS: There were 14 753 visits (mean patient age, 47 years; 69\% women) for antibiotic-inappropriate acute respiratory tract infections during the baseline period and 16 959 visits (mean patient age, 48 years; 67\% women) duringthe intervention period. Mean antibiotic prescribing rates decreased from 24.1\% at intervention start to 13.1\% at intervention month 18 (absolute difference, -11.0\%) for control practices; from 22.1\% to 6.1\% (absolute difference, -16.0\%) for suggested alternatives (difference in differences, -5.0\% [95\% CI, -7.8\% to 0.1\%]; P =.66 for differences in trajectories); from 23.2\% to 5.2\% (absolute difference, -18.1\%) for accountable justification (difference in differences, -7.0\% [95\% CI, -9.1\% to -2.9\%]; P <.001); and from 19.9\% to 3.7\% (absolute difference, -16.3\%) for peer comparison (difference in differences, -5.2\% [95\% CI, -6.9\% to -1.6\%]; P <.001). There were no statistically significant interactions (neither synergy nor interference) between interventions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among primary care practices, the use of accountable justification and peer comparison as behavioral interventions resulted in lower rates of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory tract infections.},

Using data from randomized natural field experiments at 600,000 treatment and control households across the United States, I estimate that the average program reduces energy consumption by 2.0\%. The program provides additional evidence that non-price interventions can substantially and cost effectively change consumer behavior: the effect is equivalent to that of a short-run electricity price increase of 11 to 20\%, and the cost effectiveness compares favorably to that of traditional energy conservation programs. Perhaps because the treatment included descriptive social norms, effects are heterogeneous: households in the highest decile of pre-treatment consumption decrease usage by 6.3\%, while consumption by the lowest decile decreases by only 0.3\%.

Because only true effects are expected to generate right-skewed p-curves – containing more low (.01s) than high (.04s) significant p-values – only right-skewed p-curves are diagnostic of evidential value.

abstract = {Our job as scientists is to discover truths about the world. We generate hypotheses, collect data, and examine whether or not the data are consistent with those hypotheses. Although we aspire to always be accurate, errors are inevitable. Perhaps the most costly error is a false positive, the incorrect rejection of a null hypothesis. First, once they appear in the literature, false positives are particularly persistent. Because null results have many possible causes, failures to replicate previous findings are never conclusive. Furthermore, because it is uncommon for prestigious journals to publish null findings or exact replications, researchers have little incentive to even attempt them. Second, false positives waste resources: They inspire investment in fruitless research programs and can lead to ineffective policy changes. Finally, a field known for publishing false positives risks losing its credibility. In this article, we show that despite the nominal endorsement of a maximum false-positive rate of 5\% (i.e., p ≤ .05), current standards for disclosing details of data collection and analyses make false positives vastly more likely. In fact, it is unacceptably easy to publish "statistically significant" evidence consistent with any hypothesis. The culprit is a construct we refer to as researcher degrees of freedom. In the course of collecting and analyzing data, researchers have many decisions to make: Should more data be collected? Should some observations be excluded? Which conditions should be combined and which ones compared? Which control variables should be considered? Should specific measures be combined or transformed or both? It is rare, and sometimes impractical, for researchers to make all these decisions beforehand. Rather, it is common (and accepted practice) for researchers to explore various analytic alternatives, to search for a combination that yields "sta-tistical significance," and to then report only what "worked." The problem, of course, is that the likelihood of at least one (of many) analyses producing a falsely positive finding at the 5\% level is necessarily greater than 5\%. This exploratory behavior is not the by-product of malicious intent, but rather the result of two factors: (a) ambiguity in how best to make these decisions and (b) the researcher's desire to find a statistically significant result. A large literature documents that people are self-serving in their interpretation Abstract In this article, we accomplish two things. First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

For each law, we use OLS to compute the DD estimate of its "effect" as well as the standard error of this estimate.

We use Monte Carlo simulations to investi gate how well existing methods help solve this problem. Econometric corrections that place a specific parametric form on the time-series process do not perform well. Bootstrap (taking into account the autocorrelation of the data) works well when the number of states is large enough.

@book{Mintzberg1973,
abstract = {(Review - Link below) Henry Mintzberg is the Roger Barker of the Executive Suite. Just as Barker (1 968) induced behavior setting theory from intensive observation of a handful of Kansans, Mintzberg induces a theory of managerial work from intensive observa- tion of a handful of executives. And just as Barker's work shows the ecological invalidity of some of our most cherished concepts, Mintzberg's work edits the organizational concepts we champion. Rarely has the field of organizational behavior had better evidence of the value of description and induction than is found in Mintzberg's book. And that's surprising, because his data base is mundane. Mintzberg watched five managers, each for one week, and recorded their verbal contacts, phone calls, and handling of mail in chronological order. And that's it. But, as is often the case, bland counting can be conceptually rich. Mintzberg certainly had no shortage of items on which to base his inductions. His five executives studied 659 pieces of incoming mail and generated 231 additional pieces of mail, all of which they interspersed between 368 verbal contacts. Mintzberg then categorized the purpose of each of these 1258 items and then collapsed these purposes into a set of ideas about the characteristics and the content of managerial work. The distinction between characteristics and content is a crucial one. Characteristics include things like where managers work, how long they work, at what pace they work and what media they use to do their work. Characteristics involve the context, the trappings, and the nature of the manager's work flow. This kind of information has been obtained by investiga- tors other than Mintzberg, most notably by those people (for instance, Stewart, Carlson) who had managers keep diaries. Unfortunately, what the diaries don't show is the actual content of what the manager does. The reason is simple. You've got to know in advance what people do if you want them to keep track of the frequency with which they do it. But nowhere in the literature do we have any useful em- pirical statements of just what managers do. And it is this void that Mintzberg set out to fill. In the space of seven chapters, mercifully stripped of method- ology-which is summarized in three appendices-Mintzberg manages to: review the literature on managerial work (Chapter 2); weave together both his own and existing data on charac- teristics of managerial work (Chapter 3); propose ten roles induced from his data that summarize the content of managerial work (Chapter 4); recast all of the preceding chapters into a contingency point of view using such variables as size and nature of industry and managerial style (Chapter 5); and again recast the accumulated material into a provocative set of algorithms for managerial work (Chapter 6), after which he unapologetically and thoughtfully discusses the advice he would give to managers, teachers, and scientists based on what he found. And all of this is done in a book that is read- able, well summarized and indexed, and well illustrated with clear graphics and informative data tables. The essential findings can be summarized quickly. With respect to the characteristics of managerial work, the data show that the manager works at an unrelenting pace with chronic inter- ruptions; he prefers action over reflection and verbal media over written media in his contacts, the majority of which a},

abstract = {This paper documents the effects of last place aversion in queues and its implications for customer experiences and behaviors, as well as for operating performance. An observational analysis of customers queuing at a grocery store, and four online field studies in which participants waited in virtual queues, revealed that waiting in last place diminishes wait satisfaction while increasing the probabilities of switching and abandoning queues, with detrimental implications for service capacity. The research suggests that last place aversion can lead to maladaptive customer behaviors-switching behaviors that increase wait times, and abandoning when the benefits of waiting are most pronounced. The results indicate that this behavior is partially explained by the inability to make a downward social comparison; namely, when no one is behind a queuing individual, that person is less certain that continuing to wait is worthwhile. Furthermore, this paper provides evidence that queue transparency is an effective service design lever that managers can use to reduce the deleterious effects of last place aversion in queues. When people can't see that they're in last place, the behavioral effects of last place aversion are nullified, and when they can see that they're not in last place, the tendency to renege is greatly diminished. Finally, a system-level experiment, in which pairs of queues were created and analyzed, reveals that when the effects of last place aversion are addressed, overall abandonment decreases, such that with equivalent arrival and service rates, total service capacity can be increased.},

The experiment was conducted within a tree-planting firm and provides daily observations on individual worker productivity under both compensation systems. Unrestricted statistical methods estimate the productivity gain to be 20\%. Since planting conditions potentially affect incentives, structural econometric methods are used to generalize the experimental results to out-of-sample conditions. The structural results suggest that the average productivity gain, outside of the experimental conditions, would be at least 21.7\%},

abstract = {Accuracy and consistency are critical for inspections to be an effective, fair, and useful tool for assessing risks, quality, and suppliers-and for making decisions based on those assessments. We examine how inspector schedules could introduce bias that erodes inspection quality by altering inspector stringency. Our analysis of thousands of food safety inspections reveals that inspectors are affected by the inspection outcomes at their prior inspected establishment (outcome effects), citing more violations after they inspect establishments that exhibited worse compliance levels or trends. Moreover, consistent with negativity bias, the effect is stronger after observing compliance deterioration than improvement. Inspection results are also affected by when the inspection occurs within an inspector's day (daily schedule effects): inspectors cite fewer violations after spending more time conducting inspections throughout the day, and when inspections risk prolonging their typical workday. Overall, our findings suggest that currently unreported violations would be cited if the outcome effects-which increase scrutiny-were triggered more often and if the daily schedule effects-which erode scrutiny-were reduced. For example, our estimates indicate that if outcome effects were doubled and daily schedule effects were fully mitigated, 11\% more violations would be detected, enabling remedial actions that could substantially reduce foodborne illnesses and hospitalizations. Understanding and addressing these inspection biases can help managers and policymakers improve not only food safety but also process quality, environmental practices, occupational safety, working conditions, and infrastructure.},

abstract = {Background. The severity of the 2017-2018 influenza season in the United States was high, with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating. Here, we report influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) and estimate the number of vaccine-prevented influenza-associated illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths for the 2017-2018 influenza season. Methods. We used national age-specific estimates of 2017-2018 influenza vaccine coverage and disease burden. We estimated VE against medically attended reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed influenza virus infection in the ambulatory setting using a test-negative design. We used a compartmental model to estimate numbers of influenza-associated outcomes prevented by vaccination. Results. The VE against outpatient, medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza was 38\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 31\%-43\%), including 22\% (95\% CI, 12\%-31\%) against influenza A(H3N2), 62\% (95\% CI, 50\%-71\%) against influenza A(H1N1) pdm09, and 50\% (95\% CI, 41\%-57\%) against influenza B. We estimated that influenza vaccination prevented 7.1 million (95\% CrI, 5.4 million-9.3 million) illnesses, 3.7 million (95\% CrI, 2.8 million-4.9 million) medical visits, 109 000 (95\% CrI, 39 000-231 000) hospitalizations, and 8000 (95\% credible interval [CrI], 1100-21 000) deaths. Vaccination prevented 10\% of expected hospitalizations overall and 41\% among young children (6 months-4 years). Conclusions. Despite 38\% VE, influenza vaccination reduced a substantial burden of influenza-associated illness, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States during the 2017-2018 season. Our results demonstrate the benefit of current influenza vaccination and the need for improved vaccines.},

In all treatments, we find significant overexpenditure of effort relative to the standard theoretical predictions. Identifying subjects through photo display decreases wasteful effort. Providing information feedback about others' effort does not affect the aggregate effort, but it decreases the heterogeneity of effort and significantly affects the dynamics of individual behavior. A behavioral model that incorporates a nonmonetary utility of winning and relative payoff maximization explains significant overexpenditure of effort. It also suggests that decrease in ''social distance'' between group members through social identification promotes prosocial behavior and decreases overexpenditure of effort, while improved information feedback decreases the heterogeneity of effort.},

Using a field experiment in schools and a model of dynamic tournament we examine the effect of different levels of rewards on the rate of quitting. Our experiment indicates that there is a possible tradeoff between performance and quitting. Strong incentives tournaments induced participants to exert more effort and exhibit a better performance but, at the same time, it induces a higher rate of quitting.

We explore three feedback rules: no feedback on relative performance, feedback given halfway through the production period, and continuously updated feedback. We use two pay schemes, a piece rate and a tournament. We find that overall feedback does not improve performance. In contrast to the piece-rate pay scheme there is some evidence of positive peer effects in tournaments since the underdogs almost never quit the competition even when lagging significantly behind, and front runners do not slack off. But in both pay schemes relative performance feedback reduces the quality of the low performers' work; we refer to this as a "negative quality peer effect".},

abstract = {The authors explore the interplay between consumers' progress levels toward attaining a goal and the perceived velocity in progressing toward the goal to determine consumers' motivation for further goal pursuit. The authors propose that when progress toward attaining a goal is low, consumers are primarily concerned about the question "Can I get there?" Thus, a high (vs. low) perceived velocity in progressing suggests greater expectations of goal attainment, resulting in greater motivation for pursuing the goal. However, when consumers have achieved sufficient progress and are approaching the end point, their attainment of the goal is relatively secured, so they become more concerned about the question "When will I get there?" and focus more on whether they are effectively reducing the remaining discrepancy so that they can attain the goal quickly. In this case, a low (vs. high) perceived velocity in progressing elicits greater motivation because it suggests that continued effort is needed to ensure a speedy attainment. Empirical evidence from lab and field experiments supports this hypothesis.},

abstract = {The business press characterized the March 11, 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) as the most significant disruption ever for global supply chains. In the aftermath of the GEJE, there was a great deal of debate about the risks and vulnerabilities of global supply chains and there were calls to redesign and restructure supply chain strategies. To examine this issue, we empirically estimate the effect of the GEJE on the stock prices (or shareholder value) of firms. Our analyses are based on a global sample of 460 publicly traded firms collected from articles and announcements in the business press that identify firms affected by the GEJE. We find that firms experiencing supply chain disruptions due to the GEJE lose on average 3.73\% of their shareholder value during the one month period after the GEJE, and the loss remains roughly at this level when measured over the three month period after the GEJE. This level of loss in shareholder value is economically significant. However, if we consider the claims about the widespread and significant disruptions in supply chains caused by the GEJE, together with the rarity of such an event, the loss does not seem inordinately negative. It suggests that supply chains were probably not that vulnerable to the GEJE, and/or they were able to recover quickly and reduce the losses, indicating that they were fairly resilient. We also find that subsequent to the GEJE, upstream and downstream supply chain propagation effects are negative, the contagion effect on firms related to the nuclear industry is very negative and sustained, and although the competitive effect is positive over the first month after the GEJE, much of this effect dissipates over the next two months.},

abstract = {This paper estimates the shareholder wealth affects of supply chain glitches that resulted in production or shipment delays. The results are based on a sample of 519 glitches announcements made during 1989-2000. Shareholder wealth affects are estimated by computing the abnormal stock returns (actual returns adjusted for industry and market-wide influences) around the date when information about glitches is publicly announced. Supply chain glitch announcements are associated with an abnormal decrease in shareholder value of 10.28\%. Regression analysis is used to identify factors that influence the direction and magnitude of the change in the stock market's reaction to glitches. We find that larger firms experience a less negative market reaction, and firms with higher growth prospects experience a more negative reaction. There is no difference between the stock market's reaction to pre-1995 and post-1995 glitches, suggesting that the market has always viewed glitches unfavorably. Capital structure (debt-equity ratio) has little impact on the stock market's reaction to glitches. We also provide descriptive results on how sources of responsibility and reasons for glitches affect shareholder wealth.},

In this paper, we combine an empirical investigation of the factors affecting nurse absenteeism rates with an analytical treatment of nurse staffing decisions using a novel variant of the newsvendor model. Using data from the emergency department of a large urban hospital, we find that absenteeism rates are consistent with nurses exhibiting an aversion to higher levels of anticipated workload. Using our empirical findings, we analyze a single-period nurse staffing problem considering both the case of constant absenteeism rate (exogenous absenteeism) as well as an absenteeism rate that is a function of the number of nurses scheduled (endogenous absenteeism). We provide characterizations of the optimal staffing levels in both situations and show that the failure to incorporate absenteeism as an endogenous effect results in understaffing.},

abstract = {M edical devices play an increasingly significant role in the delivery of health care today. However, persistent quality problems with medical devices and the associated recalls present potential health risks to patients and personnel using these devices. This study addresses three key issues in this regard. First, it empirically assesses the financial implications of medical device recalls to understand if these consequences are severe enough to deter firms from introducing potentially hazardous medical devices into the market, as can be inferred from the literature. Second, the study considers a cross section of medical device manufacturers to examine the effect of firm characteristics on the costs of poor quality. Third, in an attempt to explore the sources of recalls, this study investigates firm characteristics that are likely to be associated with device recalls. The econometric analyses in the study are based on data from manufacturers in the medical device industry over a four-year period (2002-2005). Contrary to our expectations, the findings of the study indicate that at an aggregate level, the market penalties for medical device recalls are not significant, i.e., at the aggregate level, the costs of poor quality are not severe. Furthermore, we find that the magnitude of financial consequences of device recalls is affected by the product scope, sales, growth prospects, and the capital structure of a firm. In our analyses exploring the sources of device recalls, we find that firms with a research and development focus, developing broader product portfolios, have a higher likelihood of device recalls. Also, we find that the likelihood of recalls decreases with prior recall experience, indicating the presence of learning. Implications of the study findings, limitations, and directions for future research are identified.},

abstract = {National policies to improve health care quality have largely focused on clinical provider outcomes and, more recently, payment reform. Yet the association between hospital leadership and quality, although crucial to driving quality improvement, has not been explored in depth. We collected data from surveys of nationally representative groups of hospitals in the United States and England to examine the relationships among hospital boards, management practices of front-line managers, and the quality of care delivered. First, we found that hospitals with more effective management practices provided higher-quality care. Second, higher-rated hospital boards had superior performance by hospital management staff. Finally, we identified two signatures of high-performing hospital boards and management practice. Hospitals with boards that paid greater attention to clinical quality had management that better monitored quality performance. Similarly, we found that hospitals with boards that used clinical quality metrics more effectively had higher performance by hospital management staff on target setting and operations. These findings help increase understanding of the dynamics among boards, front-line management, and quality of care and could provide new targets for improving care delivery. H ospitals increasingly face financial pressure to improve quality through national programs such as Hospital Value-Based Purchasing, the Hospital Re-admissions Reduction Program, and the Hospital Acquired Condition Reduction Program. Despite the recently increased emphasis by policy makers on linking payment and quality, quality improvement efforts have traditionally focused on the processes and outcomes of clinical providers. Less is known about how two critical elements , leadership and management, influence the delivery of high-quality care and how those effects might be empirically verified. 1 Several previous studies have shown an association between hospital board practices and quality of care. 2-5 Although these studies have been helpful, they have not been able to clearly delineate which specific activities of the boards affect quality of care and how they relate to hospital managers' activities. Furthermore, it is unclear whether board activities and management activities are independently important in driving quality performance. It is known that there are large variations in both how hospital boards engage with clinical quality as well as managerial practices across institutions. 2,5-8 Understanding how hospital boards and management interact with each other, and the way in which they might drive gains in quality, is critically important. The lack of empirical data in this area, however, has},

abstract = {Motivated by a collaborative study with one of the most comprehensive ocular imaging programs in the United States, we investigate the underlying three-way trade-off among operational, clinical, and financial considerations in physicians' decisions about ordering imaging tests. Laboratory tests may be processed in parallel and thus have a limited effect on patients' waiting times; imaging tests, by contrast, require patient presence and thus directly influence patients' waiting times. We use a strategic queueing framework to model a physician's decision of ordering imaging tests and show that insurance coverage is the key driver of overtesting. Our further analysis reveals the following: (i) Whereas existing studies hold that lower out-of-pocket expenses lead to higher consumption levels, we refine this statement by showing the copayment and the coinsurance rate drive the consumption in different directions. Thus, simply expanding patient cost sharing is not the solution to overtesting. (ii) Setting a low reimbursement ceiling alone cannot eliminate overtesting. (iii) The joint effect of misdiagnosis concerns and insurance coverage can lead to both overtesting and undertesting even when no reimbursement ceiling exists. These and other results continue to hold under more general conditions and are therefore robust. We enrich our model along two extensions: one with patient heterogeneity in diagnostic precision, and the other with disparities in health insurance coverage. Our findings have implications for other healthcare settings with similar trade-offs.},

The context is such that rank had no implication for current or future compensation. Compared to a control group with no rank feedback, those employees who received feedback about their rank reduced effort along both the intensive and the extensive margin: they were significantly less likely to return to work and when they did they were less productive when getting feedback about their rank.

Strengthening incentives, either through rankings or tournaments, makes workers more likely to form teams with others of similar ability instead of with their friends. Introducing rank incentives however reduces average productivity by 14\%, whereas introducing a tournament increases it by 24\%. Both effects are heterogeneous: rank incentives only reduce the productivity of teams at the bottom of the productivity distribution, and monetary prize tournaments only increase the productivity of teams at the top. We interpret these results through a theoretical framework that makes precise when the provision of team-based incentives crowds out the productivity-enhancing effect of social connections under team production.},

We study the value of sharing these data in a model with one supplier, N identical retailers, and stationary stochastic consumer demand. There are inventory holding costs and back-order penalty costs. We compare a traditional information policy that does not use shared information with a full information policy that does exploit shared information. In a numerical study we find that supply chain costs are 2.2\% lower on average with the full information policy than with the traditional information policy, and the maximum difference is 12.1\%. We also develop a simulation-based lower bound over all feasible policies. The cost difference between the traditional information policy and the lower bound is an upper bound on the value of information sharing: In the same study, that difference is 3.4\% on average, and no more than 13.8\%. We contrast the value of information sharing with two other benefits of information technology, faster and cheaper order processing, which lead to shorter lead times and smaller batch sizes, respectively. In our sample, cutting lead times nearly in half reduces costs by 21\% on average, and cutting batches in half reduces costs by 22\% on average. For the settings we study, we conclude that implementing information technology to accelerate and smooth the physical flow of goods through a supply chain is significantly more valuable than using information technology to expand the flow of information.},

abstract = {T his paper examines how firm investments in technology-based employee monitoring impact both misconduct and productivity. We use unique and detailed theft and sales data from 392 restaurant locations from five firms that adopt a theft monitoring information technology (IT) product. We use difference-indifferences models with staggered adoption dates to estimate the treatment effect of IT monitoring on theft and productivity. We find significant treatment effects in reduced theft and improved productivity that appear to be primarily driven by changed worker behavior rather than worker turnover. We examine four mechanisms that may drive this productivity result: economic and cognitive multitasking, fairness-based motivation, and perceived increases of general oversight. The observed productivity results represent substantial financial benefits to both firms and the legitimate tip-based earnings of workers. Our results suggest that employee misconduct is not solely a function of individual differences in ethics or morality, but can also be influenced by managerial policies that can benefit both firms and employees.},

abstract = {T his paper explores the rationing of bed capacity in a cardiac intensive care unit (ICU). We find that the length of stay for patients admitted to the ICU is influenced by the occupancy level of the ICU. In particular, a patient is likely to be discharged early when the occupancy in the ICU is high. This in turn leads to an increased likelihood of the patient having to be readmitted to the ICU at a later time. Such "bounce-backs" have implications for the overall ICU effective capacity-an early discharge immediately frees up capacity, but at the risk of a (potentially much higher) capacity requirement when the patient needs to be readmitted. We analyze these capacity implications, shedding light on the question of whether an ICU should apply an aggressive discharge strategy or if it should follow the old quality slogan and "do it right the first time." By comparing the total capacity usage for patients who were discharged early versus those who were not, we show that an aggressive discharge policy applied to patients with lower clinical severity levels frees up capacity in the ICU. However, we find that an increased number of readmissions of patients with high clinical severity levels occur when the ICU is capacity constrained, thereby effectively reducing peak bed capacity.},

However, not only can some supply chains continue to function smoothly, they also continue to satisfy their customers before and after a major disruption. Some key differentiators of these supply chains are cost-effective and time-efficient strategies. In this paper, certain "robust" strategies are presented that possess two properties. First, these strategies will enable a supply chain to manage the inherent fluctuations efficiently regardless of the occurrence of major disruptions. Second, these strategies will make a supply chain become more resilient in the face of major disruptions. While there are costs for implementing these strategies, they provide additional selling points for acquiring and retaining apprehensive customers before and after a major disruption.},

abstract = {W e study a single-product setting in which a firm can source from two suppliers, one that is unreliable and another that is reliable but more expensive. Suppliers are capacity constrained, but the reliable supplier may possess volume flexibility. We prove that in the special case in which the reliable supplier has no flexibility and the unreliable supplier has infinite capacity, a risk-neutral firm will pursue a single disruption-management strategy: mitigation by carrying inventory, mitigation by single-sourcing from the reliable supplier, or passive acceptance. We find that a supplier's percentage uptime and the nature of the disruptions (frequent but short versus rare but long) are key determinants of the optimal strategy. For a given percentage uptime, sourcing mitigation is increasingly favored over inventory mitigation as disruptions become less frequent but longer. Further, we show that a mixed mitigation strategy (partial sourcing from the reliable supplier and carrying inventory) can be optimal if the unreliable supplier has finite capacity or if the firm is risk averse. Contingent rerouting is a possible tactic if the reliable supplier can ramp up its processing capacity, that is, if it has volume flexibility. We find that contingent rerouting is often a component of the optimal disruption-management strategy, and that it can significantly reduce the firm's costs. For a given percentage uptime, mitigation rather than contingent rerouting tends to be optimal if disruptions are rare.},

abstract = {W e study a manufacturer that faces a supplier privileged with private information about supply disruptions. We investigate how risk-management strategies of the manufacturer change and examine whether risk-management tools are more or less valuable in the presence of such asymmetric information. We model a supply chain with one manufacturer and one supplier, in which the supplier's reliability is either high or low and is the supplier's private information. On disruption, the supplier chooses to either pay a penalty to the manufacturer for the shortfall or use backup production to fill the manufacturer's order. Using mechanism design theory, we derive the optimal contract menu offered by the manufacturer. We find that information asymmetry may cause the less reliable supplier type to stop using backup production while the more reliable supplier type continues to use it. Additionally, the manufacturer may stop ordering from the less reliable supplier type altogether. The value of supplier backup production for the manufacturer is not necessarily larger under symmetric information; for the more reliable supplier type, it could be negative. The manufacturer is willing to pay the most for information when supplier backup production is moderately expensive. The value of information may increase as supplier types become uniformly more reliable. Thus, higher reliability need not be a substitute for better information.},

How much (if any) pricing discretion headquarters should grant is a topic of debate within many firms. We investigate this issue using a unique data set from an indirect lender with local pricing discretion. We estimate that the local sales force adjusted prices in a way that improved profits by approximately 11\% on average. A counterfactual analysis shows that using a centralized, data-driven pricing optimization system could improve profits even further, up to 20\% over those actually realized. This suggests that centralized pricing-if appropriately optimized-can be more effective than field price discretion. We discuss the implications of these findings for auto lending and other industries with similar pricing processes.},

abstract = {T his work examines the process of admission to a hospital's intensive care unit (ICU). ICUs currently lack systematic admission criteria, largely because the impact of ICU admission on patient outcomes has not been well quantified. This makes evaluating the performance of candidate admission strategies difficult. Using a large patient-level data set of more than 190,000 hospitalizations across 15 hospitals, we first quantify the cost of denied ICU admission for a number of patient outcomes. We use hospital operational factors as instrumental variables to handle the endogeneity of the admission decisions and identify important specification issues that are required for this approach to be valid. Using the quantified cost estimates, we then provide a simulation framework for evaluating various admission strategies' performance. By simulating a hospital with 21 ICU beds, we find that we could save about 1.9 million per year by using an optimal policy based on observables designed to reduce readmissions and hospital length of stay. We also discuss the role of unobserved patient factors, which physicians may discretionarily account for when making admission decisions, and show that including these unobservables could result in a more than threefold increase in benefits compared to just optimizing the policy over the observable patient factors.},

abstract = {R etail store managers may not follow order advices generated by an automated inventory replenishment system if their incentives differ from the cost-minimization objective of the system or if they perceive the system to be suboptimal. We study the ordering behavior of retail store managers in a supermarket chain to characterize such deviations in ordering behavior, investigate their potential drivers, and thereby devise a method to improve automated replenishment systems. Using orders, shipments, and point-of-sale data for 19,417 item-store combinations over five stores, we show that (i) store managers consistently modify automated order advices by advancing orders from peak to nonpeak days, and (ii) this behavior is explained significantly by product characteristics such as case pack size relative to average demand per item, net shelf space, product variety, demand uncertainty, and seasonality error. Our regression results suggest that store managers improve upon the automated replenishment system by incorporating two ignored factors: in-store handling costs and sales improvement potential through better in-stock. Based on these results, we construct a method to modify automated order advices by learning from the behavior of store managers. Motivated by the management coefficients theory, our method is efficient to implement and outperforms store managers by achieving a more balanced handling workload with similar average days of inventory.},

Our findings, using data from one of the largest financial services providers in the United States, indicate that customer sensitivity to service time varies widely and predictably with observable market characteristics. In turn, we find evidence that local operating managers account for market-specific customer sensitivities to service times by deviating frequently and in predictable ways from the recommendations offered by a centralized capacity-planning model. Finally, we document that these discretionary capacity supply decisions exhibit a strong learning effect whereby experienced operating managers place more weight than their less-experienced counterparts on the market-specific trade-off between service capacity costs and customer sensitivity to service times. Overall, our results demonstrate both the importance of local knowledge as an input in service operations and the potential for incorporating richer data on customer behavior and preferences into service cost and productivity standard metrics.},

The existing policy consists of a daily payment for each patient under care with a global cap of revenues accrued during the Medicare year, which increases with each newly admitted patient. We investigate the hospice's expected profit and provide reasons for a spate of recent provider bankruptcies related to the reimbursement policy; recommendations to alleviate these problems are given. We also analyze a hospice's incentives for patient management, finding several unintended consequences of the Medicare reimbursement policy. Specifically, a hospice may seek short-lived patients (such as cancer patients) over patients with longer expected lengths of stay. The effort with which hospices seek out, or recruit, such patients will vary during the year. Furthermore, the effort they apply to actively discharge a patient whose condition has stabilized may also depend on the time of year. These phenomena are unintended and undesirable but are a direct consequence of the Medicare reimbursement policy. We propose an alternative reimbursement policy to ameliorate these shortcomings.},

We take an economic and operational (patient flow) perspective to analyze the effectiveness of this policy in encouraging hospitals to reduce readmissions. We develop a game-theoretic model that captures the competition among hospitals inherent in HRRP's benchmarking mechanism. We show that this competition can be counterproductive: it increases the number of nonincentivized hospitals, which prefer paying penalties over reducing readmissions in any equilibrium. We calibrate our model with a data set of more than 3,000 hospitals in the United States and show that under the current policy, and for a large set of parameters, 4\%-13\% of the hospitals remain nonincentivized to reduce readmissions. We also validate our model against the actual performance of hospitals in the three years since the introduction of the policy. We draw several policy recommendations to improve this policy's outcome. For example, localizing the benchmarking process-comparing hospitals against similar peers-improves the performance of the policy.},

abstract = {"A Caravan book"--Title page verso. "Every day, we make decisions on topics ranging from personal investments to schools for our children to the meals we eat to the causes we champion. Unfortunately, we often choose poorly. Nobel laureate Richard Thaler and legal scholar and bestselling author Cass Sunstein explain in this important exploration of choice architecture that, being human, we all are susceptible to various biases that can lead us to blunder. Our mistakes make us poorer and less healthy; we often make bad decisions involving education, personal finance, health care, mortgages and credit cards, the family, and even the planet itself. In Nudge, Thaler and Sunstein invite us to enter an alternative world, one that takes our humanness as a given. They show that by knowing how people think, we can design choice environments that make it easier for people to choose what is best for themselves, their families, and their society. Using colorful examples from the most important aspects of life, Thaler and Sunstein demonstrate how thoughtful "choice architecture" can be established to nudge us in beneficial directions without restricting freedom of choice. Nudge offers a unique new take--from neither the left nor the right--on many hot-button issues, for individuals and governments alike. This is one of the most engaging and provocative books to come along in many years."

@article{Chopra2004,
abstract = {Natural disasters, labor disputes, terrorism and more mundane risks can seriously disrupt or delay the flow of material, information and cash through an organization's supply chain. The authors assert that how well a company fares against such threats will depend on its level of preparedness, and the type of disruption. Each supply-chain risk to forecasts, information systems, intellectual property, procurement, inventory and capacity has its own drivers and effective mitigation strategies. To avoid lost sales, increased costs or both, managers need to tailor proven risk-reduction strategies to their organizations. Managing supply-chain risk is difficult, however. Dell, Toyota, Motorola and other leading manufacturers excel at identifying and neutralizing supply-chain risks through a delicate balancing act: keeping inventory, capacity and related elements at appropriate levels across the entire supply chain in a rapidly changing environment. Organizations can prepare for or avoid delays by "smart sizing" their capacity and inventory. The manager serves as a kind of financial portfolio manager, seeking to achieve the highest achievable profits (reward) for varying levels of supply-chain risk. The authors recommend a powerful "what if?" team exercise called "stress testing" to identify potentially weak links in the supply chain. Armed with this shared understanding, companies can then select the best mitigation strategy: holding "reserves," pooling inventory, using redundant suppliers, balancing capacity and inventory, implementing robust backup and recovery systems, adjusting pricing and incentives, bringing or keeping production in-house, and using Continuous Replenishment Programs (CRP), Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR) and other supply-chain initiatives.},

The basic premise of this research is that an individual's conscious ideas his actions. Studies are cited demonstrating that: (1) hard goals produce a higher level of performance (output) than easy goals; (2) specific hard goals produce a higher level of output than a goal of "de your best"; and (3) behavioral intentions regulate choice behavior. The also views goals and intentions as mediators of the effects of incentives on task performance. Evidence is presented supporting the view that monetary incentives, time limits, and knowledge of results do not affect performance level independently of the individual's goals and intentions. A theoretical analysis supports the same view with respect to three other incentives: participation, competition, and praise and re-proof. Finally, behavioral intentions were found to mediate the effects of money and "verbal reinforcement" on choice behavior. It is concluded that any adequate theory of task motivation must take account of the indi-vidual's conscious goals and intentions. The applied implications of the theory are discussed.},

Vaccination strategies to reduce disease burden have been implemented. However, no previous studies have systematically estimated the annual economic burden of influenza epidemics, an estimate necessary to guide policy makers effectively. Objective: We estimate age-and risk-specific disease burden, and medical and indirect costs attributable to annual influenza epidemics in the United States. Methods: Using a probabilistic model and publicly available epidemiological data we estimated the number of influenza-attributable cases leading to outpatient visits, hospitalization, and mortality, as well as time lost from work absenteeism or premature death. With data from health insurance claims and projections of either earnings or statistical life values, we then estimated healthcare resource utilization associated with influenza cases as were their medical and productivity (indirect) costs in 2003. Results: Based on 2003 US population, we estimated that annual influenza epidemics resulted in an average of 610,660 life-years lost (undiscounted), 3.1 million hospitalized days, and 31.4 million outpatient visits.},

Past evidence suggests that the committee could use a more systematic approach to incorporate observed information and to quantify the risks associated with different options. There are two key trade-offs involved in this decision. First, if the Committee decides to retain the current vaccine composition instead of updating to a new one, there is lower uncertainty in production yields, but the current vaccine could be less effective if a new virus strain spreads. Second, if the Committee decides early with less information, then manufacturers have more production time, but the reduced information increases the risk of choosing a wrong strain. We derive an optimal dynamic policy for this decision. Because of the greater uncertainty in production yields of new vaccines, the optimal thresholds are neither symmetric between retaining and updating the composition nor monotonic over time. We apply our model to past decisions using parameter values estimated from a historical case. Our analysis shows that the dynamic optimal policy can significantly improve social welfare.},

Previous economic studies, focusing on demand side, find that the equilibrium demand is always less than the socially optimal demand because self-interested individuals do not internalize the social benefit of protecting others via reduced infectiousness (positive exter-nality). In contrast, we show that the equilibrium demand can be greater than the socially optimal demand after accounting for the limited supply due to yield uncertainty and manufacturer's incentives. The main driver for this result is a second (negative) externality: Self-interested individuals ignore that vaccinating people with high infection costs is more beneficial for the society when supply is limited. We show that the extent of the negative externality can be reduced through more efficient and less uncertain allocation mechanisms. To investigate the relative effectiveness of government interventions on supply and demand sides under various demand and supply characteristics, we construct two partially centralized scenarios where the social planner (i.e., government) intervenes either on the demand side or the supply side, but not both.

Numerous studies have suggested that the performance of a division, plant, or business unit is improved to the extent that it remains focused on a narrow range of activities. Others have found similar benefits associated with focus at the level of the entire firm. A question that has received less attention, however, is whether focus at the divisional level is complementary with, or a substitute for, focus at the firm level. We explore this question by considering the performance of investigative sites in biopharmaceutical clinical trials. First, we establish that firms focusing on a particular task-at either a divisional or firm level-experience higher output and productivity with respect to that task than unfocused firms. After controlling for selection, scale, and learning effects, we find that sites that focus on conducting clinical trials significantly outperform those that mix trial activity with the provision of traditional patient care. Second, we find evidence that focus at the divisional level and firm level are substitutes. That is, organizations characterized by divisional focus alone achieve statistically similar performance to sites that are characterized by both divisional and firm focus.},

abstract = {The long-standing argument that focused operations outperform others stands in contrast to claims about the
benefits of broader operational scope. The performance benefits of focus are typically attributed to reduced
complexity, lower uncertainty, and the development of specialized expertise; the benefits of greater breadth are
linked to the economies of scope achieved by sharing common resources, such as advertising or production
capacity, across activities. Within the literature on corporate strategy, this tension between focus and breadth is
reconciled by the concept of related diversification (i.e., a firm with multiple operating units, each specializing
in distinct but related activities). We consider whether there are similar benefits to related diversification within
an operating unit and examine the mechanism that generates these benefits. Using the empirical context of
cardiovascular care within hospitals, we first examine the relationship between a hospital's level of specialization
in cardiovascular care and the quality of its clinical performance on cardiovascular patients. We find that, on
average, focus has a positive effect on quality performance. We then distinguish between positive spillovers and
complementarities to examine (1) the extent to which a hospital's specialization in areas related to cardiovascular
care directly impacts performance on cardiovascular patients (positive spillovers) and (2) whether the marginal
benefit of a hospital's focus in cardiovascular care depends on the degree to which the hospital “cospecializes” in
related areas (complementarities). In our setting, we find evidence of such complementarities in specialization},

abstract = {US guidelines provided a permissive recommendation for HPV vaccine for males in 2009, with an updated recommendation for routine vaccination in 2011. Data on vaccine uptake among males, however, remain sparse. We analyzed 2010-2011 data (collected mostly prior to the recommendation for routine vaccination) from the National Immunization Survey-Teen for a nationally representative sample of adolescent males ages 13-17 (n = 22,365). We examined HPV vaccine initiation (receipt of at least one dose based on healthcare provider records) as the primary outcome. Analyses used weighted logistic regression. HPV vaccine initiation increased from 1.4\% in 2010 to 8.3\% in 2011. Parents who reported receiving a healthcare provider recommendation to get their sons HPV vaccine were much more likely to have vaccinated sons (OR = 19.02, 95\% CI: 14.36-25.19). Initiation was also higher among sons who were Hispanic (OR = 1.83, 95\% CI: 1.24-2.71) or who were eligible for the Vaccines for Children program (OR = 1.53, 95\% CI: 1.01-2.31). Only 31.0\% of parents with unvaccinated sons indicated their sons were "somewhat likely" or "very likely" to receive HPV vaccine in the next year. The most common main reasons for parents not intending to vaccinate were believing vaccination is not needed or not necessary (24.5\%), not having received a provider recommendation (22.1\%), and lack of knowledge (15.9\%). HPV vaccination is low among adolescent males in the US, and provider recommendation for vaccination is likely key to improving vaccine uptake. Given the updated recommendation for routine vaccination and the changes in health insurance coverage that are likely to follow, continued efforts are needed to monitor HPV vaccination among males.},

abstract = {Work scheduling research typically prescribes task sequences implemented by managers. Yet employees often have discretion to deviate from their prescribed sequence. Using data from 2.4 million radiological diagnoses, we find that doctors prioritize similar tasks (batching) and those tasks they expect to complete faster (shortest expected processing time). Moreover, they exercise more discretion as they accumulate experience. Exploiting random assignment of tasks to doctors' queues, instrumental variable models reveal that these deviations erode productivity. This productivity decline lessens as doctors learn from experience. Prioritizing the shortest tasks is particularly detrimental to productivity. Actively grouping similar tasks also reduces productivity, in stark contrast to productivity gains from exogenous grouping, indicating deviation costs outweigh benefits from repetition. By analyzing task completion times, our work highlights the tradeoffs between the time required to exercise discretion and the potential gains from doing so, which has implications for how discretion over scheduling should be delegated},

abstract = {We use a detailed operational and clinical data set from a maternity hospital to investigate how workload affects decisions in gatekeeper-provider systems, where the servers act as gatekeepers to specialists but may also attempt to serve customers themselves , albeit with a probability of success that is decreasing in the complexity of the customers' needs. We study the effect of workload during a service episode on gatekeep-ers' service configuration decisions and the rate at which gatekeepers refer customers to a specialist. We find that gatekeeper-providers (midwives in our context) make substantial use of two levers to manage their workload (measured as patients per midwife): they ration resource-intensive discretionary services (epidural analgesia) for customers with noncomplex service needs (mothers with spontaneous onset of labor) and, at the same time, increase the rate of specialist referral (physician-led delivery) for customers with complex needs (mothers with pharmacologically induced labor). The workload effect in the study unit is surprisingly large and comparable in size to those for leading clinical risk factors: when workload increases from two standard deviations below to two standard deviations above the mean, noncomplex cases are 28.8\% less likely to receive an epidu-ral, leading to a cost reduction of 8.7\%, while complex cases are 14.2\% more likely to be referred for a physician-led delivery, leading to a cost increase of 2.6\%. These observations are consistent with overtreatment at both high and low workload levels, albeit for different types of patients, and suggest that smoothing gatekeeper workload would reduce variability in customer service experience.

abstract = {Public relative performance feedback (RPF) on an individual worker's productivity metrics is used in various organizations with the hopes of improving worker productivity , but its effects are not well understood. We examine whether public RPF could be leveraged to facilitate adoption of best practices in an organization by enabling the validation of best practices shared by identifiable top performers. We use data from two emergency departments, both of which shared best practices for improving productivity and one of which changed from privately to publicly disclosing RPF to physicians. The public disclosure of RPF allowed workers to identify their top-performing coworkers, which in turn enabled the identification and validation of best practices within the work group. We find that the intervention is associated with a 10.9\% improvement in physician productivity. We also find evidence for a significant reduction in variation in productivity across providers, which stems from bottom-ranked workers exhibiting differentially large improvements in productivity. These effects hold without sacrificing system-level performance , service quality, or worker attrition. Our results suggest that public disclosure of RPF, along with the validation of the best practices being shared, can improve worker productivity.

To evaluate the association between an active choice intervention in the electronic health record (EHR) and changes in influenza vaccination rates. Observational study. Adults eligible for influenza vaccination with a clinic visit at one of three internal medicine practices at the University of Pennsylvania Health System between September 2010 and March 2013. The EHR confirmed patient eligibility during the clinic visit and, upon accessing the patient chart, prompted the physician and their medical assistant to actively choose to "accept" or "cancel" an order for the influenza vaccine. Change in influenza vaccination order rates at the intervention practice compared to two control practices for the 2012-2013 flu season, comparing trends during the prior two flu seasons adjusting for time trends and patient and clinic visit characteristics. The sample (n = 45,926 patients) was 62.9\% female, 35.9\% white, and 54.4\% black, with a mean age of 50.2 years. Trends were similar between practices during the 2 years in the pre-intervention period. Vaccination rates increased in both groups in the post-intervention year, but the intervention practice using active choice had a significantly greater increase than the control (adjusted difference-in-difference: 6.6 percentage points; 95\% CI, 5.1-8.1; P < 0.001), representing a 37.3\% relative increase compared to the pre-intervention period. More than 99.9\% (9938/9941) of orders placed during the study period resulted in vaccination. Active choice through the EHR was associated with a significant increase in influenza vaccination rates.},

Goal-setting literature suggests that workers respond to challenging but achievable goals with increased performance. Empirical evidence supports the notion of goals increasing performance; however the evidence on how attainability of goals affects performance is mixed. This paper tests whether efforts increase, improving performance as the goals become more attainable. We are employing a unique set of publicly available marathon data from 1970 to 2015 to directly analyze the effect of goal attainability on performance. With the probable goal of qualifying for the Boston Marathon, we test if runners increase their effort, and consequently improve their performance if they enter a new age group and as a result have a more attainable goal. We find that runners who enter a new age group perform better than the runners whose qualifying time did not change. This effect is seen with runners in younger age groups, but not found in the results of runners in more advanced years.},

abstract = {Performance rankings are a very common workplace management practice. Behavioral theories suggest that providing performance rankings to employees, even without pecuniary consequences, may directly shape effort due to the rank's effect on self-image. In a three-year randomized control trial with full-time furniture salespeople (n=1754), I study the effect on sales performance in a two-by-two experimental design where I vary (i) whether to privately inform employees about their performance rank; and (ii) whether to give benchmarks, i.e. data on the current performance required to be in the top 10\%, 25\% and 50\%. The salespeople's compensation is only based on absolute performance via a high-powered commission scheme in which rankings convey no direct additional financial benefits. There are two important innovations in this experiment. First, prior to the start of the experiment all salespeople were told their performance ranking. Second, employees operate in a multi-tasking environment where they can sell multiple brands. There are four key results: First, removing rank feedback actually increases sales performance by 11\%, or 1/10 th of a standard deviation. Second, only men (not women) change their performance. Third, adding benchmarks to rank feedback significantly raises performance, but it is not significantly different from providing no feedback. Fourth, as predicted by the multi-tasking model, the treatment effect increases with the scope for effort substitution across furniture brands as employees switch their effort to other tasks when their rank is worse than expected.},

abstract = {We evaluate the results of a field experiment designed to measure the effect of prompts to form implementation intentions on realized behavioral outcomes. The outcome of interest is influenza vaccination receipt at free on-site clinics offered by a large firm to its employees. All employees eligible for study participation received reminder mailings that listed the times and locations of the relevant vaccination clinics. Mailings to employees randomly assigned to the treatment conditions additionally included a prompt to write down either (i) the date the employee planned to be vaccinated or (ii) the date and time the employee planned to be vaccinated. Vaccination rates increased when these implementation intentions prompts were included in the mailing. The vaccination rate among control condition employees was 33.1\%. Employees who received the prompt to write down just a date had a vaccination rate 1.5 percentage points higher than the control group, a difference that is not statistically significant. Employees who received the more specific prompt to write down both a date and a time had a 4.2 percentage point higher vaccination rate, a difference that is both statistically significant and of meaningful magnitude. behavioral economics | nudge | libertarian paternalism | public health | flu shot S easonal influenza leads to >200,000 hospitalizations and >8,000 deaths in the United States each year (1, 2). The influenza vaccine is widely available at low cost and reduces mortality (3-5), morbidity (3-6), and healthcare costs (3, 6). Nevertheless, many of those for whom vaccination is indicated fail to comply with CDC recommendations for vaccination (7). If low compliance is the result of careful calculations by individuals weighing the costs and benefits of vaccination, it may be difficult and expensive for policymakers and organizational leaders to increase vaccination rates. However, if low compliance is the result of forgetfulness or procrastination, low-cost interventions that use psychological tools may be effective at increasing vaccination rates and improving public health. The potential for low-cost psychological interventions to change behavior has been documented in previous research (8-10). For example, changing defaults-the outcomes that result when no action is taken-has been shown to have a sizeable effect on organ donation rates (11), immunization rates (12), and savings plan enrollment (13). Providing information on social norms has been used to reduce household energy consumption (14, 15). This paper evaluates another behavioral intervention-planning prompts-in a field setting. Research in psychology has demonstrated that prompting people to develop a plan of the form, "When situation x arises, I will implement response y," increases attainment of desired goals (16-20). Simply asking people to develop such a plan, or an "imple-mentation intention," is all that is necessary to trigger an association between the desired behavior and a concrete future moment (19). A prompt to form an implementation intention is a "nudge" (8) in the direction of desired behavior that can be applied at minimal expense and does not restrict individual autonomy (9). To investigate the efficacy of implementation intentions prompts, we conducted a three-arm randomized controlled trial. The outcome of interest was influenza vaccination receipt. Employees at a large firm were randomly assigned to receive one of three mailings about workplace vaccination clinics. All mailings informed recipients of the dates and times of clinics at their work location. In addition, some mailers prompted recipients to write down either (i) the date they planned to get their vaccination (date plan condition), or (ii) the date and time they planned to get their vaccination (time plan condition). Fig. 1 shows the component of the mailer that varied across conditions. Comparing the vaccination rates of employees in the two treatment conditions to the vaccination rates of employees in the control condition whose mailers did not include an implementation intentions prompt, we find that vaccination rates were increasing in the specificity of the prompt received. The vaccination rate among control condition employees was 33.1\%. Employees who received the prompt to write down just a date had a regression adjusted vaccination rate 1.5 percentage points higher than the control group, a difference that is not statistically significant at the 5\% level. Those who received the more specific prompt to write down both a date and a time had a 4.2 percentage point higher regression-adjusted vaccination rate, a difference that is both statistically significant at the 5\% level and of a meaningful magnitude. The intervention had a larger impact at sites that offered vaccination clinics on only one day than at sites that offered clinics on multiple days, suggesting that implementation intentions prompts may be more effective in settings where an opportunity is available for only a short time. To our knowledge, this is the first large field study to evaluate the power of implementation intentions prompts in isolation and without confounding influences. Although past research has demonstrated that planning interventions can increase the frequency of prompted behavior for various outcomes ranging from mammography to voting (19), our study differs from past research in several important ways. First, in many past studies, the effect of the planning intervention could not be distinguished from the effect of social pressure because the intervention involved face-to-face or telephone contact (16, 20-24). This study does not involve social pressure: whether subjects ignored the mailings was not observed, and any plans formulated were not communicated to the experimenters, the employer, or any other party. Second, the treatment conditions in many previous studies have provided subjects with supplemental information that was relevant to the outcome participants were being prompted to},

abstract = {W e analyze a large, detailed operational data set from a restaurant chain to shed new light on how workload (defined as the number of tables or diners that a server simultaneously handles) affects servers' performance (measured as sales and meal duration). We use an exogenous shock-the implementation of labor scheduling software-and time-lagged instrumental variables to disentangle the endogeneity between demand and supply in this setting. We show that servers strive to maximize sales and speed efforts simultaneously, depending on the relative values of sales and speed. As a result, we find that, when the overall workload is small, servers expend more and more sales efforts with the increase in workload at a cost of slower service speed. However, above a certain workload threshold, servers start to reduce their sales efforts and work more promptly with the further rise in workload. In the focal restaurant chain, we find that this saturation point is currently not reached and, counterintuitively, the chain can reduce the staffing level and achieve both significantly higher sales (an estimated 3\% increase) and lower labor costs (an estimated 17\% decrease).},

abstract = {M uch of prior work in the area of service operations management has assumed service rates to be exogenous to the level of load on the system. Using operational data from patient transport services and cardiotho-racic surgery-two vastly different health-care delivery services-we show that the processing speed of service workers is influenced by the system load. We find that workers accelerate the service rate as load increases. In particular, a 10\% increase in load reduces length of stay by two days for cardiothoracic surgery patients, whereas a 20\% increase in the load for patient transporters reduces the transport time by 30 seconds. Moreover, we show that such acceleration may not be sustainable. Long periods of increased load (overwork) have the effect of decreasing the service rate. In cardiothoracic surgery, an increase in overwork by 1\% increases length of stay by six hours. Consistent with prior studies in the medical literature, we also find that overwork is associated with a reduction in quality of care in cardiothoracic surgery-an increase in overwork by 10\% is associated with an increase in likelihood of mortality by 2\%. We also find that load is associated with an early discharge of patients, which is in turn correlated with a small increase in mortality rate.},

Four studies were conducted to test whether perceived goal progress hinders the pursuit of the focal goal. These studies demonstrate that in the course of self-regulation progress along one goal liberates people to pursue inconsistent goals. Furthermore, merely planning to make goal progress in the future may facilitate incongruent choice of immediate action.},

Although the intervention successfully improved the target behavior, less is known about any spillovers, positive or negative, that impacted the program's net benefit. This novel examination presents an opportunity to advance our knowledge of this important question, particularly because many theories predict that balancing behaviors in other domains (e.g., reduced exercise) can occur. Our results show a positive and long-lasting persistence effect for the treatment group, even after the incentive was removed. Moreover, we observe no negative spillover effects into related domains such as exercise, and no negative impact on customer loyalty. These results support the use of incentive-based interventions and highlight the importance, for both theory and practice, of examining their extended effects.

The experiment was designed to assess local and short-term effects as well as spatial and temporal substitution, heterogeneity, and spillovers. Subjects offered 5, 10, and 15 gift cards to give blood were more likely to donate and more so for the higher reward values. The incentives also led to spatial displacement and a short-term shift in the timing of donation activity, but they had no long-term effects. Many of the effects were also heterogeneous in the population. We also detected a spillover effect whereby informing some individuals of rewards through official ARC channels led others who were not officially informed to be more likely to donate. Thus, the effect of incentives on prosocial behavior includes not only the immediate local effects but also spatial displacement, social spillovers, and dramatic heterogeneity. We discuss the implications of these findings for organizations with activities that rely on volunteers for the supply of key inputs or products as well as for government agencies and public policy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Low human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination coverage is an urgent public health problem requiring action. To identify policy remedies to suboptimal HPV vaccination, we assessed the relationship between states' school entry requirements and adolescent vaccination. METHODS We gathered data on states' school entry requirements for adolescent vaccination (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis [Tdap] booster; meningococcal; and HPV) from 2007 to 2012 from Immunization Action Coalition. The National Immunization Survey-Teen provided medical record-verified vaccination data for 99 921 adolescents. We calculated coverage (among 13- to 17-year-olds) for individual vaccinations and concomitant vaccination. HPV vaccination outcomes were among female adolescents. Analyses used weighted longitudinal multivariable models. RESULTS States with requirements for Tdap booster and meningococcal vaccination had 22 and 24 percentage point increases in coverage for these vaccines, respectively, compared with other states (both P < .05). States with HPV vaccination requirements had <1 percentage point increase in coverage for this vaccine (P < .05). Tdap booster and meningococcal vaccination requirements, respectively, were associated with 8 and 4 percentage point spillover increases for HPV vaccination coverage (both P < .05) and with increases for concomitant vaccination (all P < .05). CONCLUSIONS Ensuring all states have meningococcal vaccination requirements could improve the nation's HPV vaccination coverage, given that many states already require Tdap booster but not meningococcal vaccination for school entry. Vaccination programs and clinicians should capitalize on changes in adolescent vaccination, including concomitant vaccination, that may arise after states adopt vaccination requirements. Additional studies are needed on the effects of HPV vaccination requirements and opt-out provisions.},

This systematization opens the door to precise quantitative inference in small-sample comparative studies, without precluding the application of qualitative approaches. Borrowing the expression from Sidney Tarrow, the synthetic control method allows researchers to put “qualitative flesh on quantitative bones.”We illustrate the main ideas behind the synthetic control method by estimating the economic impact of the 1990 German reunification onWest Germany.},

We demonstrate that following Proposition 99 tobacco consumption fell markedly in California relative to a comparable synthetic con- trol region. We estimate that by the year 2000 annual per capita cigarette sales in California were about 26 packs lower than what they would have been in the absence of Proposition 99. Using new inferential methods proposed in this ar- ticle, we demonstrate the significance of our estimates. Given that many policy interventions and events of interest in social sciences take place at an aggregate level (countries, regions, cities, etc.) and affect a small number of aggregate units, the potential applicability of synthetic control methods to comparative case studies is very large, especially in situations where traditional regression methods are not appropriate},

Using a real-effort experiment, we aim to discover whether people respond to the specific rank that they achieve. In particular, we leverage random variation in the allocation of rank among subjects who exerted the same effort to obtain a causal estimate of the rank response function that describes how effort provision responds to the content of rank-order feedback. We find that the rank response function is U-shaped. Subjects exhibit 'first-place loving' and 'last-place loathing', that is subjects work hardest after being ranked first or last.

abstract = {I n this paper, we study how social planners should exploit social comparisons to pursue their objectives. We consider two modes of social comparison, referred to as behind-averse and ahead-seeking behaviors, depending on whether individuals experience a utility loss from underperforming or a utility gain from overperforming relative to their peers. Modeling social comparison as a game between players, we find that ahead-seeking behavior leads to output polarization, whereas behind-averse behavior leads to output clustering. A social planner can mitigate these effects in two ways: (i) by providing the full reference distribution of outputs instead of an aggregate reference point based on the average output and (ii) by assigning players into uniform rather than diverse reference groups. Social planners may thus need to tailor the reference structure to the predominant mode of social comparison and their objective. A performance-focused social planner may set the reference structure so as to maximize the output of either the top or the bottom player depending on whether she puts greater marginal weight to larger or smaller outputs. When the social planner also cares about utility, she faces a dilemma because performance optimization may not be aligned with utility maximization. Inevitably, the social planner will have to confront equity issues because better performance may not reflect greater effort or greater ability.},

We investigate experimentally the role of status-seeking behavior in sabotage and cheating activities aiming at improving one's performance ranking in a flat-wage environment. We find that average effort is higher when individuals are informed about their relative performance. However, ranking feedback also favors disreputable behavior. Some individuals do not hesitate to incur a cost to improve their rank by sabotaging others' work or by increasing artificially their own performance. Introducing sabotage opportunities has a strong detrimental effect on performance. Therefore, ranking incentives should be used with care. Inducing group identity discourages sabotage among peers but increases in-group rivalry. Data, as supplemental material, are available at http://dx.},

A cost-based evaluation of such services should depend on the total cost associated with the service-i.e., the price and the amount of time taken for completion. In this paper, we demonstrate that the characteristics of the path to the final destination also influence evaluation and choice. Specifically, we show that segments of idle time and travel away from the final destination are seen as obstacles in the progress towards the destination, and hence lower the choice likelihood of the path. Further, we show that the earlier such obstacles occur during the service, the lower is the choice likelihood. We present an analytical model of consumer choice and test its predictions in a series of experiments. Our results show that in choosing between two services that cover the same displacement in the same time (i.e., identical average progress), consumer choice is driven by the perception of progress towards the goal (i.e., by virtual progress). In a final experiment, we show that the effects of virtual progress may outweigh the effects of actual average progress.},

abstract = {A previous literature cautions that paying workers for performance might crowd out nonmonetary motives to work hard. Empirical evidence from the field, however, has been based on between-subjects designs that are best suited for detecting crowding out due to low-powered incentives. High-powered incentives in the workplace tend to increase output, but it is unknown whether this masks crowding out. This paper uses a within-subject experimental design and finds evidence that crowding out also extends to high-powered incentives in a real work setting with paid workers. There is individual heterogeneity, however, with a minority of workers reporting crowding in of motivation. Thus, the impact of performance pay might depend on the mix of worker types.

Psychology offers three general propositions for understanding and intervening to increase uptake where vaccines are available and affordable. The first proposition is that thoughts and feelings can motivate getting vaccinated. Hundreds of studies have shown that risk beliefs and anticipated regret about infectious disease correlate reliably with getting vaccinated; low confidence in vaccine effectiveness and concern about safety correlate reliably with not getting vaccinated. We were surprised to find that few randomized trials have successfully changed what people think and feel about vaccines, and those few that succeeded were minimally effective in increasing uptake. The second proposition is that social processes can motivate getting vaccinated. Substantial research has shown that social norms are associated with vaccination, but few int...},

In each experiment, Ss performed an activity during 3 different periods, and observations relevant to their motivation were made. External rewards were given to the experimental Ss during the 2nd period only, while the control Ss received no rewards. Results indicate that (a) when money was used as an external reward, intrinsic motivation tended to decrease; whereas (b) when verbal reinforcement and positive feedback were used, intrinsic motivation tended to increase. Discrepant findings in the literature are reconciled using a new theoretical framework which employs a cognitive approach and concentrates on the nature of the external reward. (26 ref.)

However, from the care provider's point of view, ED care is not a never-ending process, but rather occurs in discrete work shifts and may require passing unfinished work to the next care provider at the end of the shift. We use data from a large, academic medical center ED to show that the patients' rate of service completion varies over the course of the physician shift. Further, patients that have experienced a physician handoff have a higher rate of service completion than non-handed off patients. As a result, a patient's expected treatment time is impacted by when in the physician's shift treatment begins. We also show that patients that have been handed off are more likely to revisit the ED within three days, suggesting that patient handoffs lower clinical quality. Lastly, we use simulation to show that shift length and new-patient cutoff rules can be used to reduce handoffs, but at the expense of system throughput.},

abstract = {P roduct launch-an event when a new product debuts for production in a plant-is an important phase in product development. But launches disrupt manufacturing operations, resulting in productivity losses. Using data from North American automotive plants from years 1999-2007, we estimate that a product launch entails an average productivity loss of 12\%-15\% at the plant level. This translates to a monetary loss of 42-53 million per launch in lost productivity. We identify several ways to mitigate the decrease in productivity. Product (or mix) flexibility in the body shop is critical for reducing the productivity loss. A plant's past experiences with product launches as well as with manufacturing similar products (specifically, on the same platform as the launch product) temper the productivity losses even further. Nevertheless, there are subtle differences in the accrued learning with these two types of experiences: whereas the positive impact of platform experience persists over time, the learning accrued with launching other products in the same plant decays more quickly. Altogether, our results suggest that launching products at a flexible plant with appropriate platform experience could recover approximately 31 million per launch in lost productivity.},

Findings from a panel data set of U.S.-based pharmaceutical plants over a 13-year period reveal that colocation of manufacturing and R\&D relates to better conformance quality, on average, across the entire sample. We find that these benefits of colocation persist throughout the time period we study (1994-2007), which is surprising, given the rapid development of information and communication technologies during that time. These benefits are particularly enhanced for manufacturing plants operating with processes that involve a high level of tacit process knowledge and that belong to large firms. Our findings highlight the importance of matching organizational design with process and firm characteristics in settings involving knowledge interdependence. They also highlight the continued value of physical proximity through geographical colocation between manufacturing and R\&D activities to achieve desired quality outcomes.},

abstract = {The design and use of standard processes are foundational recommendations in many operations practices. Yet, given the demonstrated performance benefits of standardized processes, it is surprising that they are often not followed consistently. One way to ensure greater compliance is by electronically monitoring the activities of individuals, although such aggressive monitoring poses the risk of inducing backlash. In the setting of hand hygiene in healthcare, a context where compliance with standard processes is frequently less than 50\% and where this lack of compliance can result in negative consequences, we investigated the effectiveness of electronic monitoring. We did so using a unique, radio frequency identification (RFID)-based system deployed in 71 hospital units. We found that electronically monitoring individual compliance resulted in a large, positive increase in compliance. We also found that there was substantial variability in the effect across units and that units with higher levels of preactivation compliance experienced increased benefits from monitoring relative to units with lower levels of prepreactivation compliance. By observing compliance rates over three and a half years, we investigated the persistent effects of individual monitoring and found that compliance rates initially increased before they gradually declined. Additionally, in multiple units, individual monitoring was discontinued, allowing for an investigation of the impact of removing the intervention on compliance. Surprisingly, we found that, after removal, compliance rates declined to below prepreactivation levels. Our findings suggest that, although individual electronic monitoring can dramatically improve process compliance, it requires sustained managerial commitment.

abstract = {Sustaining operational productivity in the completion of repetitive tasks is critical to many organizations' success. Yet research points to two different work-design–related strategies for accomplishing this goal: specialization to capture the benefits of repetition and variety (i.e., working on different tasks) to keep workers motivated and provide them opportunities to learn. In this paper, we investigate how these two strategies may bring different productivity benefits over time. For our empirical analyses, we use two and a half years of transaction data from a Japanese bank's home loan application-processing line. We find that over the course of a single day, specialization, as compared to variety, is related to improved worker productivity. However, when we examine workers' experience across a number of days, we find that variety helps improve worker productivity. Additionally, we show that part of this benefit results from workers' cumulative experience with changeovers. Our results highlight the need for organizations to transform specialization and variety into mutually reinforcing strategies rather than treating them as mutually exclusive. Overall, our paper identifies new ways to improve operational performance through the effective allocation of work.\nThis paper was accepted by Christian Terwiesch, operations management.},

Operations is the function that is uniquely associated with the design and management of these processes. The problem domains of concern to the department have been, and remain, the marshalling of inputs, the transformation itself, and the distribution of outputs in pursuit of this value-creating end.

Using 28 million vehicle emissions tests from more than 11,000 facilities, we show that increased competition is associated with greater inspection leniency, a service quality attribute that customers value but is illegal and socially costly. Firms with more competitors pass customer vehicles at higher rates and are more likely to lose customers whom they fail, suggesting that competition intensifies pressure on facilities to provide illegal leniency.

However, the types of resources considered in previous research do not reflect the properties of many commonly exchanged resources, namely information, social support, and material goods. In this article, I identify two resource dimensions that underlie and affect exchange: (1) duplicability, that is, whether a resource's provider retains control of the resource after exchange and (2) transferability, that is, whether a resource's recipient can exchange the resource in another relation. I present a causal model to explain how these dimensions affect cohesion through the mediating effects of structural power, exchange frequency, and uncertainty. Notably, resource variation alters the source of structural power, making it necessary to specify when different power mechanisms will operate and their disparate effects on the other mediating factors. A laboratory experiment provides support for the causal model. Resource characteristics fundamentally shape both the exchange process and the outcomes actors experience.},

abstract = {This study refines and experimentally tests a theory of relational cohesion that explains how and when actors become committed to one another in the context of multiactor exchange. The theory asserts that frequent social exchange results in (1) positive emotions that solidify and strengthen the person-to-group bond and (2) uncertainty reduction that renders the focal group more salient in relation to others. These two mechanisms produce a sense of psychological group formation and ultimately increase observable acts of commitment. In a "productive exchange" setting, three actors negotiate a joint venture that requires the assent of all members. The exchanges featured two forms of commitment behavior: the giving of small token gifts and the decision to invest in a three-way prisoner's dilemma. The results suggest that positive emotion and uncertainty reduction are theoretically distinct and affect commitment behavior through different mechanisms. The article concludes by discussing the general implications for commitment and social order.},

abstract = {This study uses an affect theory of social exchange (Lawler 2001) to investigate how and when network structures generate "micro social orders." Micro social order entails recurrent interactions, emotional reactions, perceptions of a group, and affective sentiments. The core theoretical argument is that micro orders, involving behavioral, cognitive, and affective dimensions, develop and are stronger to the degree that (1) actors engage in highly joint tasks or activities and (2) these tasks generate a sense of shared responsibility for the interaction outcomes. A laboratory experiment varies different forms of social exchange - negotiated, reciprocal, generalized, and productive - within a network structure, and offers strong support for the core expectation that productive forms of exchange generate the strongest micro order. Conversely, generalized exchange generates the weakest order, with negotiated and reciprocal forms in between. In general, productive exchange bolsters more exchange behavior, more positive feelings, perceptions of cohesion at the network level, and affective attachments to the network as a social unit. This research has broad implications for the conditions under which task activity promotes micro social orders that involve strong person-to-group ties (as opposed to person-to-person ties) and affective sentiments regarding the social unit.},

In this study, we use social exchange theory to investigate why employees help other employees. We hypothesize, based on the norm of reciprocity (Gouldner, 1960), that a significant cause of an employee's helping behavior is how much organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) the employee has received from coworkers. To provide evidence of the discriminant validity of OCB received as an antecedent of helping behavior, we also assess its effects on another form of extra-role behavior, voice, as well as in-role performance. We found, in a sample of 157 employee-supervisor dyads, that OCB received was related to helping behavior after controlling for several antecedents of helping behavior identified in past research, and was less related to voice and in-role behavior, as hypothesized. Implications for theory and practice are presented.},

Although effective in reducing staffing level, hence labor cost, the potential impact of just-in-time scheduling on workers' productivity and the firm's revenue is not well understood. Using a data set of 1,444,044 transactions from 25 stores of a full-service casual dining restaurant chain in the United States, we study how just-in-time scheduling impacts worker productivity. We consider two types of just-in-time schedules: (1) short-notice schedules that are assigned to servers shortly before the day of service (mostly two days in our data) and (2) real-time schedules that are assigned to servers on the day of service. We show that short-notice schedules do not harm server productivity overall, but real-time schedules do by 4.4\%. Our analysis indicates this may be because servers reduce their up-selling and cross-selling efforts when working on real-time schedules. We then propose an analytical scheduling model that accounts for both the value of staffing flexibility created through just-in-time scheduling and its impact on server productivity to inform the firm how to use just-in-time scheduling to improve profitability. Through a case study, we demonstrate that with the 4.4\% productivity loss during the real-time schedules, the managers should shift from the heavy use of real-time scheduling toward scheduling more servers with longer advance notice. Such a shift not only provides more predictable work schedules for the workers but can also improve restaurants' expected profit by up to 1\%, a significant number for the low-margin restaurant industry.

Objective: To describe the changes in ED visits that occurred from 1997 through 2007 in the adult and pediatric US populations by sociodemographic group, designation of safety-net ED, and trends in ambulatory care - sensitive conditions. Design, Setting, and Participants: Publicly available ED visit data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) from 1997 through 2007 were stratified by age, sex, race, ethnicity, insurance status, safety-net hospital classification, triage category, and disposition. Codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), were used to extract visits related to ambulatory care - sensitive conditions. Visit rates were calculated using annual US Census estimates. Main Outcome Measures: Total annual visits to US EDs and ED visit rates for population subgroups. Results: Between 1997 and 2007, ED visit rates increased from 352.8 to 390.5 per 1000 persons (rate difference, 37.7; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -51.1 to 126.5; P=.001 for trend); the increase in total annual ED visits was almost double of what would be expected from population growth. Adults with Medicaid accounted for most of the increase in ED visits; the visit rate increased from 693.9 to 947.2 visits per 1000 enrollees between 1999 and 2007 (rate difference, 253.3; 95\% CI, 41.1 to 465.5; P=.001 for trend). Although ED visit rates for adults with ambulatory care-sensitive conditions remained stable, ED visit rates among adults with Medicaid increased from 66.4 in 1999 to 83.9 in 2007 (rate difference, 17.5; 95\% CI, -5.8 to 40.8; P=.007 for trend). The number of facilities qualifying as safety-net EDs increased from 1770 in 2000 to 2489 in 2007. Conclusion: These findings indicate that ED visit rates have increased from 1997 to 2007 and that EDs are increasingly serving as the safety net for medically underserved patients, particularly adults with Medicaid. {\textcopyright}2010 American Medical Association.

abstract = {Importance: Patterns in emergency department (ED) use by rural populations may be an important indicator of the health care needs of individuals in the rural United States and may critically affect rural hospital finances. Objective: To describe urban and rural differences in ED use over a 12-year period by demographic characteristics, payers, and characteristics of care, including trends in ambulatory care-sensitive conditions and ED safety-net status. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study of ED visit data from the nationally representative National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey examined ED visit rates from January 2005 to December 2016. Visits were divided by urban and rural classification and stratified by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and payer. Emergency departments were categorized as urban or rural in accordance with the US Office of Management and Budget classification. Codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), were used to extract visits related to ambulatory care-sensitive conditions. Safety-net status was determined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition. Visit rates were calculated using annual US Census Bureau estimates. National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey estimates were generated using provided survey weights and served as the numerator, yielding an annual, population-adjusted rate. Data were analyzed from June 2017 to November 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Emergency department visit rates for 2005 and 2016 with 95\% confidence intervals, accompanying rate differences (RDs) comparing the 2 years, and annual rate change (RC) with accompanying trend tests using weighted linear regression models. Results: During the period examined, rural ED visit estimates increased from 16.7 million to 28.4 million, and urban visits increased from 98.6 million to 117.2 million. Rural ED visits increased for non-Hispanic white patients (13.5 million to 22.5 million), Medicaid beneficiaries (4.4 million to 9.7 million), those aged 18 to 64 years (9.6 million to 16.7 million), and patients without insurance (2.7 million to 3.4 million). Rural ED visit rates increased by more than 50\%, from 36.5 to 64.5 visits per 100 persons (RD, 28.9; RC, 2.2; 95\% CI, 1.2 to 3.3), outpacing urban ED visit rates, which increased from 40.2 to 42.8 visits per 100 persons (RD, 2.6; RC, 0.2; 95\% CI, -0.1 to 0.6). By 2016, nearly one-fifth of all ED visits occurred in the rural setting. From 2005 to 2016, rural ED utilization rates increased for non-Hispanic white patients (RD, 26.1; RC, 1.6; 95\% CI, 0.4 to 2.8), Medicaid beneficiaries (RD, 56.4; RC, 4.1; 95\% CI, 2.1 to 6.1), those aged 18 to 44 years (46.9 to 81.6 visits per 100 persons; RD, 34.7; RC, 2.3; 95\% CI, 1.1 to 3.5) as well as those aged 45 to 64 years (27.5 to 53.9 visits per 100 persons; RD, 26.5; RC, 1.6; 95\% CI, 0.7 to 2.5), and patients without insurance (44.0 to 66.6 visits per 100 persons per year; RD, 22.6; RC, 2.7; 95\% CI, 0.2 to 5.2), with a larger proportion of rural EDs categorized as safety-net status. Conclusions and Relevance: Rural EDs are experiencing important changes in utilization rates, increasingly serving a larger proportion of traditionally disadvantaged groups and with greater pressure as safety-net hospitals.},

abstract = {Emergency Departments (EDs) commonly face capacity imbalances and long wait times in a service system handling patients with different priorities. These problems are particularly important for low-priority patients who often remain in the queue for extended periods. We investigate two distinct approaches to address these challenges: fast track (FT) and dynamic priority queue (DPQ). Traditionally, EDs have prioritized patients using an Emergency Severity Index (ESI), in conjunction with FT, to strictly or partially dedicate resources to different ESI patient classes. With our proposed DPQ, patients are prioritized using ESI and additional real-time operational information about the patient, specifically the amount of accumulated wait time and flow time. Using an empirical simulation, we compare the impact of different resource allocation and prioritization approaches on patient length of stay (LOS), including the existing system at the ED, FT with strict and partial dedication and the possibility of shorter and less variable service times, and versions of the proposed DPQ using simple dynamic prioritization. Our main results are that: (i) the DPQ approach dominates the other approaches tested; (ii) for various ED sizes, FT with strict and partial dedication do not reduce average LOS of low-priority patients without significantly increasing average LOS of high-priority patients, unless service time mean and variance are reduced; (iii) DPQ using accumulated wait time or accumulated flow time improves performance. The results are robust to changes in the proportion of patients in each priority level. Overall, expanding decision making about patient prioritization from only considering the patient's clinical condition to also including operational data can improve performance dramatically, even without improved service times.},

abstract = {The expansive learning curve literature in Operations Management has established how various facets of prior experience improve average performance. In this paper, we explore how increased cumulative experience affects performance variability, or consistency. We use a two-stage estimation method of a heteroskedastic learning curve model to examine the relationship between experience and performance variability among paramedics at the London Ambulance Service. We find that for paramedics with lower experience, an increase in experience of 500 jobs reduces the variance of task completion time by 8.7\%, in addition to improving average completion times by 2.7\%. Similar to prior results on the average learning curve, we find a diminishing impact of additional experience on the variance learning curve. We provide an evidence base for how to model the learning benefits of cumulative experience on performance in service systems. Our findings imply that the benefits of learning are substantially underestimated if the consistency effect is ignored. Specifically, our estimates indicate that queue lengths (or wait times) might be overestimated by as much as 4\% by ignoring the impact of the variance learning curve in service systems. Furthermore, our results suggest that previously established drivers of productivity should be revisited to examine how they affect consistency, in addition to average performance.},

They investigate conditions under which managers crowdsource design and determine whether such decisions subsequently boost product sales. The empirical analysis is guided by qualitative insights gathered from executive interviews. The authors use a novel data set from a pioneering crowdsourcing firm and find that three concept design characteristics-perceived usability, reliability, and technical complexity-are associated with the decision to crowdsource design. They use an instrumental variable method accounting for the endogenous nature of crowdsourcing decisions to understand when such a decision affects downstream sales. The authors find that design crowdsourcing is positively related to unit sales and that this effect is moderated by the idea quality of the initial product concept. Using a change-score analysis of consumer ratings, they find that design crowdsourcing enhances perceived reliability and usability.

Some of these patients may be at higher medical risk depending on their timing of leaving the ED.

Methods: Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of ED visits using the 2009-2011 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Results: A total of 100 962 ED visits were documented in the 2009-2011 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, representing a weighted count of 402 211 907 total ED visits. 2646 (2.62\%) resulted in a disposition of left without completing medical care. Of these visits, 1792 (67.7\%) left before being seen by a medical provider versus 854 (32.3\%) who left after medical provider evaluation but before a final disposition. Patients who left after being assessed by a medical provider were older, had higher acuity visits, were more likely to have visited an ED without nursing triage, arrived more often by ambulance, and were more likely to have private insurance than to be self-paying or to have other payment arrangements (e.g. worker's compensation or charity/no charge). Conclusions: When comparing all patients who left the ED before completion of care, those who left after versus before medical provider evaluation differed in their patient, hospital, and visit characteristics and may represent a high risk patient group.},

Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional analysis using the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) from 1998 to 2006. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify predictors of LWBS. Results: The national LWBS rate was 1.7 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6 to 1.9) patients per 100 emergency department (ED) visits each year. In multivariate analysis, patients at extremes of age (<18 years, odds ratio [OR] = 0.80, 95\% CI = 0.66 to 0.96; and ≥65 years, OR = 0.46, 95\% CI = 0.32 to 0.64) and nursing home residents (OR = 0.29, 95\% CI = 0.08 to 1.00) were associated with lower LWBS rates. Nonwhites (black or African American (OR = 1.41, 95\% CI = 1.22 to 1.63) and Hispanic (OR = 1.25, 95\% CI = 1.04 to 1.49), Medicaid (OR = 1.47, 95\% CI = 1.27 to 1.70), self-pay (OR = 1.96, 95\% CI = 1.65 to 2.32), or other insurance (OR = 2.09, 95\% CI = 1.74 to 2.52) patients were more likely to LWBS. Visit characteristics associated with LWBS included visits for musculoskeletal (OR = 0.70, 95\% CI = 0.57 to 0.85), injury/poisoning/adverse event (OR = 0.65, 95\% CI = 0.53 to 0.80), and miscellaneous (OR = 1.56, 95\% CI = 1.19 to 2.05) complaints. Visits with low triage acuity were more likely to LWBS (OR = 3.59, 95\% CI = 2.81 to 4.58), whereas visits that were work-related were less likely to LWBS (OR = 0.19, 95\% CI = 0.12 to 0.29). Institutional characteristics associated with LWBS were visits in metropolitan areas (OR = 2.11, 95\% CI = 1.66 to 2.70) and teaching institutions (OR = 1.33, 95\% CI = 1.06 to 1.67). Conclusions: Several patient, visit, and hospital characteristics are independently associated with LWBS. Prediction and benchmarking of LWBS rates should adjust for these factors. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.},

Although extensive research has shown that cumulative experience leads to performance improvement across numerous contexts, the question of how much of this improvement is due to mere experience and how much is due to collective learning processes has received little attention. We argue that organizational learning processes may allow some organizations to benefit more than others from equivalent levels of experience. We thus propose that learning curves can vary across organizations engaged in the same "learning task," due to organizational learning effects. To investigate this proposition, we investigate cardiac surgery departments implementing a new technology for minimally invasive cardiac surgery. Data on operative procedure times from a sample of 660 patients who underwent the new operation at 16 different institutions are analyzed. The results confirm that cumulative experience is a significant predictor of learning, and further reveal that the slope of the learning curve varies significantly across organizations. Theoretical and practical implications of the work are discussed.},

abstract = {Study objective: We determine the effect of crowding on emergency department (ED) waiting room, treatment, and boarding times across multiple sites and acuity groups. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study that included ED visit and inpatient medicine occupancy data for a 1-year period at 4 EDs. We measured crowding at 30-minute intervals throughout each patient's ED stay. We estimated the effect of crowding on waiting room time, treatment time, and boarding time separately, using discrete-time survival analysis with time-dependent crowding measures (ie, number waiting, number being treated, number boarding, and inpatient medicine occupancy rate), controlling for patient demographic and clinical characteristics. Results: Crowding substantially delayed patients' waiting room and boarding times but not treatment time. During the day shift, when the number boarding increased from the 50th to the 90th percentile, the adjusted median waiting room time (range 26 to 70 minutes) increased by 6\% to 78\% (range 33 to 82 minutes), and the adjusted median boarding time (range 250 to 626 minutes) increased by 15\% to 47\% (range 288 to 921 minutes), depending on the site. Crowding delayed the care of high-acuity level 2 patients at all sites. During crowded periods (ie, 90\%), the adjusted median waiting room times of high-acuity level 2 patients were 3\% to 35\% higher than during normal periods, depending on the site and crowding measure. Conclusion: Using discrete-time survival analysis, we were able to dynamically measure crowding throughout each patient's ED visit and demonstrate its deleterious effect on the timeliness of emergency care, even for high-acuity patients.},

abstract = {This paper studies heuristic thinking and cognitive bias using a natural experiment from the field. The setting for the study is a set of acute care hospitals, where we examine the care process and discharge decisions for individual patients. Determining a patient's suitability for discharge is cognitively taxing, calling for the decision maker to draw on up-to-date clinical expertise and detailed information. We postulate that bounded rationality in decision making can lead the care provider to substitute clinical readiness for discharge, a more cognitively complex attribute, with the observed days spent in the hospital, a more easily accessible heuristic. Identifying the use of the heuristic is challenging , as patient readiness for discharge is often correlated with the time spent in the hospital. Our identification strategy, motivated by regression discontinuity design, exploits a discontinuity associated with the admission process at midnight. On the basis of more than 177,000 patient discharges spanning eight years, we find support for the use of the heuristic: 19.2\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) [14.6\%, 23.8\%]) of patients incur an increased length of stay by a day on average as a result of the heuristic. We also find that the reliance on the heuristic is associated with overtreatment; postmidnight patients on average cost \$512 (95\% CI [\$100, \$923]) more but without any corresponding improvement in healthcare outcomes. A counterfactual analysis shows that eliminating the heuristic lowers the bed capacity needed to maintain the same patient throughput. For example, for a hospital unit in our study with a bed capacity of 106, eliminating the heuristic would allow the hospital to maintain the same throughput with 1.61 fewer beds on average. These findings have a number of implications for policy formulation and managerial decision making. History: Accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management.

abstract = {Background: Primary care is known to improve outcomes and lower health care costs, prompting recent U.S. policy efforts to expand its role. Nonetheless, there is early evidence of a decline in per capita primary care visit rates, and little is understood about what is contributing to the decline. Objective: To describe primary care provider (PCP) visit trends among adults enrolled with a large, national, commercial insurer and assess factors underlying a potential decline in PCP visits. Design: Descriptive repeated cross-sectional study using 100\% deidentified claims data from the insurer, 2008–2016. A 5\% claims sample was used for Poisson regression models to quantify visit trends. Setting: National, population-based. Participants: Adult health plan members aged 18 to 64 years. Measurements: PCP visit rates per 100 member-years. Results: In total, 142 million primary care visits among 94 million member-years were examined. Visits to PCPs declined by 24.2\%, from 169.5 to 134.3 visits per 100 member-years, while the proportion of adults with no PCP visits in a given year rose from 38.1\% to 46.4\%. Rates of visits addressing low-acuity conditions decreased by 47.7\% (95\% CI, -48.1\% to -47.3\%). The decline was largest among the youngest adults (-27.6\% [CI, -28.2\% to -27.1\%]), those without chronic conditions (-26.4\% [CI, -26.7\% to -26.1\%]), and those living in the lowest-income areas (-31.4\% [CI, -31.8\% to -30.9\%]). Out-of-pocket cost per problem-based visit rose by \$9.4 (31.5\%). Visit rates to specialists remained stable (-0.08\% [CI, -0.56\% to 0.40\%]), and visits to alternative venues, such as urgent care clinics, increased by 46.9\% (CI, 45.8\% to 48.1\%). Limitation: Data were limited to a single commercial insurer and did not capture nonbilled clinician–patient interactions. Conclusion: Commercially insured adults have been visiting PCPs less often, and nearly one half had no PCP visits in a given year by 2016. Our results suggest that this decline may be explained by decreased real or perceived visit needs, financial deterrents, and use of alternative sources of care.},

abstract = {Despite the frequency with which individuals perform in team environments as well as the robust relationship between attentional resource allocation/cognitive workload and performance, the impact of team environment on attentional resource allocation and cognitive workload has only recently begun to be investigated. To address this shortcoming, we used a dual-task paradigm (concurrent auditory oddball discrimination and cognitive-motor tasks) and recorded phenomenological reports (National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NASA]-Task Load Index) to assess attentional resource allocation and cognitive workload, respectively, while participants engaged in neutral, adaptive, and maladaptive team environments. We observed that individuals performing the cognitive-motor task in maladaptive team environments exhibited poorer oddball performance relative to neutral (p = .004, d = 0.836) and adaptive (p = .01, d = 0.754) team environments. Furthermore, participants reported higher Task Load Index scores in maladaptive team environments relative to neutral (p = .007, d = 1.229) and adaptive (p = .002, d = 1.590) team environments. Thus, individuals engaging in adaptive and neutral team environments allocated their attentional resources much more efficiently and experienced considerably less cognitive workload relative to maladaptive team environments. Additionally, individuals performing in adaptive team environments exhibited substantially better cognitive-motor task performance relative to neutral (p = .009, d = 0.931) and maladaptive (p = .017, d = 1.005) team environments. These results illustrate the importance of (1) avoiding maladaptive team environments so as to prevent team members from inefficiently allocating their attentional resources and experiencing excessive levels of cognitive workload and (2) generating adaptive team environments to enhance task performance.

@article{Altman2020,
abstract = {Problem Definition: Research in Operations Management has focused mainly on system-level load, ignoring the fact that service agents and customers express a variety of emotions that may impact service processes and outcomes. We introduce the concept of emotional load-the emotional demands that customer behaviors impose on service agents-to analyze how customer emotions affect service worker's behavior. Academic / Practical Relevance: Most theories in Organizational Behavior literature predict that emotions expressed by customers reduce agent's cognitive abilities and therefore should reduce the agent's speed (e.g. by increasing the service time required to serve an angry customer). We aim to shed light on the magnitude of that phenomenon while addressing important econometric challenges. We also investigate an important mechanism that drives this relation, namely, agent effort. We discuss practical opportunities that arise from measuring emotional load, and how it can be used to enhance productivity. Methodology: We measure the emotional load of agents using sentiment analysis tools that quantify pos-itive/negative customer emotion expressions in an online chat-type contact center, and link it to agent behavior: response time, and the length and number of messages required to complete a service request. Identifying a causal effect of customer emotion on agent behavior using observational data is challenging because there are confounding factors associated to the complexity of service requests, which are related to both customer emotions and agent behavior. Our identification strategy uses panel data and exploits the variation across messages within a focal request, using fixed effects to control for unobserved factors associated to case complexity. Instrumental variables are also used to address issues of measurement error and other endogeneity problems; the instruments are based on exogenous shocks to agent performance indicators that have been studied in the service operations literature. Results: Analyses show that emotional load created by negative customer emotions increases agent response time (RT), the length of the agent messages (a measure of effort) and the required number of messages needed to complete a service request. Emotional load and agent RT reciprocally effect each other, with long agent RTs and a high number of messages producing more negative customer emotion. Managerial Implications: We suggest that the emotional content in customer communications should be an important factor to consider when assigning workload to agents in a service system. Our study provides a rigorous methodology to measure the emotional content from customer text messages and objectively evaluate its associated workload. We discuss how this can be used to improve staffing decisions and dynamic workload routing through real-time monitoring of emotional load.},

The benefits of such relationships for both firms and workers are often understood in terms of increased flexibility. Less understood is the impact of freelancing on individual performance. While it is often presumed that the performance of freelancers is largely portable across organizations, it is also possible that a given worker's performance may vary across organizations if he or she develops firm-specific skills and knowledge over time. We examine this issue empirically by considering the performance of cardiac surgeons, many of whom perform operations at multiple hospitals within narrow periods of time. Using patient mortality as an outcome measure, we find that the quality of a surgeon's performance at a given hospital improves significantly with increases in his or her recent procedure volume at that hospital but does not significantly improve with increases in his or her volume at other hospitals. Our findings suggest that surgeon performance is not fully portable across hospitals (i.e., some portion of performance is firm specific). Further, we provide preliminary evidence suggesting that this result may be driven by the familiarity that a surgeon develops with the assets of a given organization.},

For more information on INFORMS, its publications, membership, or meetings visit Abstract. Classical queueing theory has typically focused on customers, and server availability has been taken for granted. However, data accessibility and the emergence of complex service systems, for example, call centers, revealed the need to stochastically model the complex behavior of servers. In this work, we propose a new model that accommodates such behavior; we call it Erlang-S, where "S" stands for servers. Our model assumes a pool of present servers, some of whom are available to serve customers from the queue while others are not, and the process of becoming available or unavailable is modeled explicitly. Our focus here is on applying the model to real systems, specifically call centers. Estimating the parameters of the new model from call-center data is challenging because reality is observed discretely in time as opposed to its continuous evolution. We therefore use an expectation-maximization algorithm that computes the expected number of relevant quantities given the discrete-time data. Erlang-S differs from the Erlang-A model, which has been commonly used for modeling call centers: the latter model assumes that all agents who are present are, in fact, available for service. When comparing predictions of the two models against call-center data, we find that Erlang-A generally overestimates queue length and consequently also the fraction of abandonment, and Erlang-S predicts reality more closely and usefully. Our conclusion is that it is important to model explicitly server dynamics to obtain accurate and valuable models of complex service systems.

However, in many systems, particularly service and professional work, judgment is frequently required to determine how much time to allocate to a task. In this paper, we show that introducing discretion in task completion adds a fourth variability buffer, quality, to the well-known buffers of capacity, inventory and time. To gain insight into the managerial implications of this difference, we model the work of one-and two-worker systems with discretionary task completion as controlled queues. After characterizing the optimal control policy and identifying some practical heuristics, we use this model to examine the differences between discretionary and nondiscretionary work. We show that in systems with discretionary task completion, (i) adding capacity may actually increase congestion, and (ii) task variability in service time can improve system performance. This implies that it may be suboptimal to expect shorter delays as a result of a capacity increase, and that task variability reduction may not be an appropriate goal in systems with discretionary task completion. We also find that the benefit of queue pooling is smaller in systems with discretionary task completion than in systems with nondiscretionary task completion.},

This study focuses on one of these key dynamics: helping among information technology (IT) implementation project team members. We uniquely distinguish between perceptions of receiving more help than one personally provides to other team members (positive inequity), vs. giving more than one receives (negative inequity). We argue, using an equity theory frame, that members have a tendency to resolve perceived inequity by adjusting subsequent levels of helping, but that the extent of adjustment is moderated by task interdependence. Results from an empirical evaluation of 591 members in 107 IT implementation teams, examined at several points throughout their project cycles, provide insight into these relationships. Extending and bounding equity theory, we find that lower interdependence augments the effect of positive inequity on subsequent helping, but leaves the effect of negative inequity unaffected. Further, we find support for an inverted U-shaped relationship between the level of subsequent helping in a team and the final cost of implementation. This holds critical implications for project team design and ensuing dynamics.},

Currently, most models assume that processing times are independent. We consider the differences in behavior of workers in low-and high-inventory production lines. Using a laboratory experiment we show that workers speed up when they are the cause of idle time on the line. This means that processing time distributions are not independent of the size of the buffer, of the processing speed of co-workers, or of the amount of inventory in the system. We show that the direction of these effects is predictable and that the magnitude is significant. In particular, there is less idle time and higher output than would be predicted using assumptions of independence. In this experiment the effect completely canceled productivity loss due to blocking and starving. This work is important in understanding both the motivation of workers in low-inventory systems and the implications of models of manufacturing flow lines.},

Using behavioral experiments, we study the impact of queue design on worker productivity in service systems that involve human servers. Specifically, we consider two queue design features: queue structure, which can be either parallel queues (multiple queues with a dedicated server per queue) or a single queue (a pooled queue served by multiple servers), and queue-length visibility, which can provide either full or blocked visibility. We find that (1) the single-queue structure slows down the servers, illustrating a drawback of pooling, and (2) poor visibility of the queue length slows down the servers; however, this effect may be mitigated, or even reversed, by pay schemes that incentivize the servers for fast performance. We provide additional managerial insights by isolating two behavioral drivers behind these results-task interdependence and saliency of feedback.

For more information on INFORMS, its publications, membership, or meetings visit Servers in many real queueing systems do not work at a constant speed. They adapt to the system state by speeding up when the system is highly loaded or slowing down when load has been high for an extended time period. Their speed can also be constrained by other factors, such as geography or a downstream blockage. We develop a state-dependent queueing model in which the service rate depends on the system "load" and "overwork." Overwork refers to a situation where the system has been under a heavy load for an extended time period. We quantify load as the number of users in the system, and we operationalize overwork with a state variable that is incremented with each service completion in a high-load period and decremented at a rate that is proportional to the number of idle servers during low-load periods. Our model is a quasi-birth-and-death process with a special structure that we exploit to develop efficient and easy-to-implement algorithms to compute system performance measures. We use the analytical model and simulation to demonstrate how using models that ignore adaptive server behavior can result in inconsistencies between planned and realized performance and can lead to suboptimal, unstable, or oscillatory staffing decisions.},

We modify the Erlang-A model to account for service slowdowns and carry out the performance analysis in the quality-and efficiencydriven (QED) regime. We find that when the load sensitivity is low, the system can achieve QED performance, but the square-root staffing parameter requires an adjustment to achieve the same performance as an ordinary Erlang-A queue. When the load sensitivity is high, the system alternates randomly between a QED and an efficiency-driven (ED) regime performance levels, a phenomenon that we refer to as bistability. We analyze how the system scale and model parameters affect the bistability phenomenon and propose an admission control policy to avoid ED performance.},

However, although speeding up service rate during periods of congestion may address a present congestion issue, it may actually exacerbate the problem by increasing the need for rework. We introduce a state-dependent queuing network where service times and return probabilities depend on the "overloaded" and "underloaded" state of the system. We use a fluid model to examine how different definitions of "overload" affect the long-term behavior of the system and provide insight into the impact of using speedup. We identify scenarios where speedup can be helpful to temporarily alleviate congestion and increase access to service. For such scenarios, we provide approximations for the likelihood of speedup to service. We also identify scenarios where speedup should never be used; moreover, in such a situation, an interesting bi-stability arises, such that the system shifts randomly between two equilibria states. Hence, our analysis sheds light on the potential benefits and pitfalls of using speedup when the subsequent returns may be unavoidable.

abstract = {Although pooling queues offers in principle many operational benefits, these may not always be achieved in practice. One reason, observed in the empirical study by Song et al. (2015), relates to customer ownership. In this paper, we formalize these empirical observations by developing a game-theoretic model to assess the performance of pooling when servers choose their capacities strategically and exhibit varying scopes of customer ownership, captured by two cost components, respectively associated with the processing time and the waiting time of a server's customers. We show that the core benefits of pooling are mostly annihilated in this setting. In fact, for any given scope of customer ownership, the queue configuration has almost no impact on the customers' average throughput time unless (i) servers' degree of customer ownership is so low that they choose to operate at high utilization and (ii) they care much more about their customers' processing times than about their waiting times. Under these conditions, adopting a dedicated queue configuration can yield significantly lower throughput times. This prescription becomes even more pertinent if the switch to a dedicated queue configuration is associated with an expansion in the scope of customer ownership, as may happen in practice.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that the processing speed of employees in service-based queueing systems is impacted by various behavioral factors. However, there is limited analytical work to investigate how these behavioral factors affect the overall performance of different queueing system designs. In this study, we focus on the response of human servers to the design and congestion level of the queueing system in which they operate. Specifically, we incorporate two behavioral factors into multi-server analytical queueing models: (1) server speedup due to increase of workload, and (2) server slowdown due to social loafing when multiple workers share the workload. We evaluate how these factors affect the performance of both the multi-server single-queue (SQ) and multi-server parallel-queue (PQ) system and the relative superiority of each system with respect to the number of customers in queue and the expected wait time in queue. We show that the impact of workload-dependent speedup can be decomposed into a direct effect and indirect effect on system performance. The direct effect leads to a reduced queue size due to increased expected service rate, while the indirect effect decreases queue size due to the “smoothing” effect. We quantify the performance impacts associated with both behavioral factors, illustrate the conditions where each effect dominates, and derive threshold values for these behavioral effects beyond which PQ systems outperform SQ systems. We also consider strategic routing and its impact on the performance of PQ systems. Our analytical contributions and numerical analyses offer important managerial guidance regarding the choice of the queueing system design and provide a theoretical foundation for future research in behavioral queueing.},

We study how queue configuration affects human servers' service time by comparing dedicated queues with shared queues using field data from a natural experiment in a supermarket. We hypothesize that queue configuration may affect servers' service rate through several mechanisms: pooling may affect service rate directly as a result of social loafing effect and competition effect and indirectly via its impact on queue length. To investigate these impacts, we take advantage of the supermarket's checkout layout and use a data set containing both checkout transaction details and queue information collected from video recordings in the supermarket. After we control for the queue length, we find that servers in dedicated queues are about 10.7\% faster than those in shared queues, mainly because of the social loafing effect. We also demonstrate that pooling has an indirect negative effect on service time through its impact on queue length. In addition, the queue configuration's direct effect and its indirect queue length effect function independently of each other. In aggregation, the social loafing effect dominates, and servers slow down (a 6.86\% increase in service time) in shared queues. History: Accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management.},

The goal of our research is to explore patient flow data through the lens of a queueing scientist. The means is exploratory data analysis (EDA) in a large Israeli hospital, which reveals important features that are not readily explainable by existing models. Questions raised by our EDA include: Can a simple (parsimonious) queueing model usefully capture the complex operational reality of the Emergency Department (ED)? What time scales and operational regimes are relevant for modeling patient length of stay in the Internal Wards (IWs)? How do protocols of patient transfer between the ED and the IWs influence patient delay, workload division and fair-ness? EDA also underscores the importance of an integrative view of hospital units by, for example, relating ED bottlenecks to IW physician protocols. The significance of such questions and our related findings raise the need for novel queueing models and theory, which we present here as research opportunities.},

For more information on INFORMS, its publications, membership, or meetings visit Traditionally, research focusing on the design of routing and staffing policies for service systems has modeled servers as having fixed (possibly heterogeneous) service rates. However, service systems are generally staffed by people. Furthermore, people respond to workload incentives; that is, how hard a person works can depend both on how much work there is and how the work is divided between the people responsible for it. In a service system, the routing and staffing policies control such workload incentives; and so the rate servers work will be impacted by the system's routing and staffing policies. This observation has consequences when modeling service system performance, and our objective in this paper is to investigate those consequences. We do this in the context of the M/M/N queue, which is the canonical model for large service systems. First, we present a model for "strategic" servers that choose their service rate to maximize a trade-off between an "effort cost," which captures the idea that servers exert more effort when working at a faster rate, and a "value of idleness," which assumes that servers value having idle time. Next, we characterize the symmetric Nash equilibrium service rate under any routing policy that routes based on the server idle time (such as the longest idle server first policy). We find that the system must operate in a quality-driven regime, in which servers have idle time, for an equilibrium to exist. The implication is that to have an equilibrium solution the staffing must have a first-order term that strictly exceeds that of the common square-root staffing policy. Then, within the class of policies that admit an equilibrium, we (asymptotically) solve the problem of minimizing the total cost, when there are linear staffing costs and linear waiting costs. Finally, we end by exploring the question of whether routing policies that are based on the service rate, instead of the server idle time, can improve system performance.},

We observed 159 clinicians in 2095 outpatient consultations at 126 health facilities in rural Tanzania. Surprisingly, we find no association between caseload and the level of effort per patient. Clinicians appear to have ample amounts of idle time.

abstract = {Problem Definition: In the modern workplace, it is increasingly common for workers to concurrently attend to tasks across multiple physical locations. However, frequent site switching can lead to increased setup and overhead costs. Specifically, workers expend significant time and cognitive effort getting reoriented with personnel, operating processes, tools, and resources whenever they switch sites. In this paper, we look at the productivity and quality implications of multi-site work. Academic / Practical Relevance: Although multi-site workplace deployment is increasingly common, its impact on people operations has not been examined in the operations management literature. We contribute to the literature by studying the effect of multi-siting on individual worker productivity and quality of output. Methodology: To estimate the effect of multi-site operations on performance, we turn to a setting where multi-site worker assignment is common-that of physicians who have admitting privileges at multiple hospitals. We collected detailed data on individual physicians practicing in 83 hospitals between 1999 and 2010. Our extensive data set includes detailed operational and clinical factors associated with over 950,000 patient encounters. Our empirical analysis takes the form of a panel, where we follow a given physician over time, and link short-term multi-siting to patient level outcomes. Results: We find that multi-siting negatively impact productivity. Specifically, for each additional site at which a physician works, we observe a 2\% increase in patient length of stay. For each site served, the likelihood of a patient developing a complication increases by 3\%. Greater travel distance between sites and lack of focus at a given site explain the performance declines due to multi-siting. In addition, we find that the performance declines due to multi-site operation are reduced among low-complexity patients, and among highly-experienced physicians. Managerial Implications: Multi-site performance losses need to be traded-off against the potential benefits. The negative effects of multi-siting can be mitigated by limiting multi-site deployment to simpler tasks, and among highly-experienced physicians. Managers can decrease switching costs of multi-site work by standardizing workflows, processes, and tools across sites. In addition, the practice of multi-site work can be limited to sites that are physically proximate to avoid the overhead costs associated with excessive travel.},

For about a decade now, we have been fortunate to work with our colleague, mentor and friend, Larry Brown, on the collection and analysis of large call-center datasets. This work has provided many fascinating windows into the world of call-center operations, stimulating further research and affecting management practice. Larry's inexhaustible curiosity and creativity, sharp insight and unique technical power, have continuously been an inspiration to us. We look forward to collaborating with and learning from him on many occasions to come. In this paper, we study operational heterogeneity of call center agents. Our proxy for heterogeneity is agents' service times (call durations), a performance measure that prevalently "enjoys" tight management control. Indeed, managers of large call centers argue that a 1-second increase/decrease in average service time can translate into additional/reduced operating costs on the order of millions of dollars per year. We are motivated by an empirical analysis of call-center data, which identifies both short-term and long-term factors associated with agent heterogeneity. Operational consequences of such heterogeneity are then illustrated via discrete event simulation. This highlights the potential benefits of analyzing individual agents' operational histories. We are thus naturally led to a detailed analysis of agents' learning-curves, which reveals various learning patterns and opens up new research opportunities.},

We argue that safety tipping points occur when managerial escalation policies are exhausted and workload variability buffers are depleted. Front-line clinical staff is forced to ration resources and, at the same time, becomes more error prone as a result of elevated stress hormone levels. We confirm the existence of safety tipping points for in-hospital mortality using the discharge records of 82,280 patients across six high-mortality-risk conditions from 256 clinical departments of 83 German hospitals. Focusing on survival during the first seven days following admission, we estimate a mortality tipping point at an occupancy level of 92.5\%. Among the 17\% of patients in our sample who experienced occupancy above the tipping point during the first seven days of their hospital stay, high occupancy accounted for one in seven deaths. The existence of a safety tipping point has important implications for hospital management. First, flexible capacity expansion is more cost-effective for safety improvement than rigid capacity, because it will only be used when occupancy reaches the tipping point. In the context of our sample, flexible staffing saves more than 40\% of the cost of a fully staffed capacity expansion, while achieving the same reduction in mortality. Second, reducing the variability of demand by pooling capacity in hospital clusters can greatly increase safety in a hospital system, because it reduces the likelihood that a patient will experience occupancy levels beyond the tipping point. Pooling the capacity of nearby hospitals in our sample reduces the number of deaths due to high occupancy by 34\%.},

We examine how new routines are developed in organizations in which existing routines are reinforced by the technological and organizational context. All hospitals studied had top-tier cardiac surgery departments with excellent reputations and patient outcomes yet exhibited striking differences in the extent to which they were able to implement a new technology that required substantial changes in the operating-room-team work routine. Suc- cessful implementers underwent a qualitatively different team learning process than those who were unsuccessful. Analysis of qualitative data suggests that implementation involved four process steps: enrollment, preparation, tri- als, and reflection. Successful implementers used enroll- ment to motivate the team, designed preparatory practice sessions and early trials to create psychological safety and encourage new behaviors, and promoted shared meaning and process improvement through reflective practices. By illuminating the collective learning process among those directly responsible for technology imple- mentation, we contribute to organizational research on routines and technology adoption.},

Despite the attention given to team familiarity and its contingencies, prior work has focused on whether team members have worked together, not on which team members have worked together, and under what conditions. In this paper, I parse overall team familiarity to consider effects of geographic location and the hierarchical roles of team members. Using data on all software-development projects completed over 3 years at a large Indian firm in the global outsourced software services industry, I find that team familiarity gained when team members work together in the same location has a significantly more positive effect on team performance compared with team familiarity gained while members were collaborating in different locations. Additionally, I find that hierarchical team familiarity (a manager's experience with front-line team members) and horizontal team familiarity (front-line team members' experience gained with one another) have differential effects on project team performance. These findings provide insight into the relationship between team experience and team performance. {\textcopyright} 2011 Production and Operations Management Society.},

Implicit in this approach is the assumption that teams are stable in their membership and internal organization. In practice, however, such stability is rare, because the composition and structure of teams often change over time (e.g., between projects). In this paper, we use detailed data from an Indian software services firm to examine how such changes may affect the accumulation of experience within, and the performance of, teams. We find that the level of team familiarity (i.e., the average number of times that each member has worked with every other member of the team) has a significant positive effect on performance, but we observe that conventional measures of the experience of individual team members (e.g., years at the firm) are not consistently related to performance. We do find, however, that the role experience of individuals in a team (i.e., years in a given role within a team) is associated with better team performance. Our results offer an approach for capturing the experience held by fluid teams and highlight the need to study context-specific measures of experience, including role experience. In addition, our findings provide insight into how the interactions of team members may contribute to the development of broader firm capabilities.},

Our instruments for founder-CEO status are the proportion of the firm's founders that are dead and the number of people who founded the company. We find strong evidence that founder-CEO status is endogenous in performance regressions and that good performance makes it less likely that the founder retains the CEO title. After factoring out the effect of performance on founder-CEO status, we identify a positive causal effect of founder-CEOs on firm performance that is quantitatively larger than the effect estimated through standard OLS regressions. We also find that founder-CEOs are more likely to relinquish the CEO post after periods of either unusually low or unusually high operating performances.

abstract = {Learning by doing represents an important mechanism through which organizations prosper. Some firms, however, learn from their experience at a dramatic rate, while other firms exhibit very little learning at all. Three factors have been identified that affect the rate at which firms learn: (a) the proficiency of individual workers, (b) the ability of firm members to leverage knowledge accumulated by others, and (c) the capacity for coordinated activity inside the organization. Each factor varies with a particular kind of experience. An increase in cumulative individual experience increases individual proficiency. An increase in cumulative organizational experience provides individuals with the opportunity to benefit from knowledge accumulated by others. An increase in cumulative experience working together promotes more effective coordination and teamwork. To gain insight into factors responsible for the learning curve, we examine the contribution of each kind of experi- ence to performance, while controlling for the impact of the other two. The study context is a teaching hospital. The task is a total joint replacement procedure, and the performance metric is procedure completion time. We find that each kind of experience makes a distinct contribution to team performance. We discuss the implications of our findings for the learning-by-doing framework in general, and learning in the team context in particular.},

abstract = {In services where teams come together for short collaborations, managers are often advised to strive for high team familiarity so as to improve coordination and, consequently, performance. However, inducing high team familiarity, by keeping team membership intact, can limit workers' opportunities to acquire useful knowledge and alternative practices from exposure to a broader set of partners. We introduce an empirical measure for prior partner exposure and estimate its impact (along with that of team familiarity) on operational performance using data from the London Ambulance Service. Our analysis focuses on ambulance transports involving new paramedic recruits, where exogenous changes in team membership enable clean identification of the performance effect. Specifically, we investigate the impact of prior partner exposure on time spent during patient pickup at the scene and patient handover at the hospital. We find that the effect varies with the process characteristics. For the patient pickup process, which is less standardized, greater partner exposure directly improves performance. For the more standardized patient handover process, this beneficial effect is triggered beyond a threshold of sufficient individual experience. In addition, we find that the beneficial performance impact of prior partner exposure is amplified during periods of high workload, for both processes. Finally, a counterfactual analysis based on our estimates shows that a team formation strategy emphasizing partner exposure outperforms one that emphasizes team familiarity by about 9.2\% in our empirical context.},

abstract = {In many workplaces, temporary teams comprised of cross-discipline team members convene and coordinate complex work, despite team members having not worked together before. Most related research has found consistent performance benefits when members of temporary teams work together multiple times (team familiarity). Recent work in this area broke new conceptual ground by instead exploring the learning and performance benefits that team members gain by being exposed to many new partners. However, that new work examined partner exposure within solo-discipline teams. In this paper, we aim to extend this research area by developing and testing theory about partner exposure in temporary cross-discipline teams where members are working across professional and discipline boundaries. We use visit-level data from a hospital ED and leverage the ad hoc assignment of attendings, nurses, and residents to teams and the round-robin assignment of patients to these teams as our identification strategy. We find a significant positive performance impact of residents' exposure to more nurses and a significant negative impact of residents' exposure to more attendings. Both of these effects are lessened on patient cases with more structured workflows. In teams that do not include a resident, we find a significant negative performance effect of nurses' exposure to more attendings. The magnitudes of these effects do not differ based on whether the experiences were accumulated more recently or longer ago. Our results suggest that interaction with cross-discipline partners is an important but often unrecognized part of disciplinary training and team composition.},

abstract = {Objective We aimed to evaluate the association between patient chief complaint and the time interval between patient rooming and resident physician self-assignment ("pickup time"). We hypothesized that significant variation in pickup time would exist based on chief complaint, thereby uncovering resident preferences in patient presentations. Methods A retrospective medical record review was performed on consecutive patients at a single, academic, university-based emergency department with over 50,000 visits per year. All patients who presented from August 1, 2012, to July 31, 2013, and were initially seen by a resident were included in the analysis. Patients were excluded if not seen primarily by a resident or if registered with a chief complaint associated with trauma team activation. Data were abstracted from the electronic health record (EHR). The outcome measured was "pickup time," defined as the time interval between room assignment and resident self-assignment. We examined all complaints with >100 visits, with the remaining complaints included in the model in an "other" category. A proportional hazards model was created to control for the following prespecified demographic and clinical factors: age, race, sex, arrival mode, admission vital signs, Emergency Severity Index code, waiting room time before rooming, and waiting room census at time of rooming. Results Of the 30,382 patients eligible for the study, the median time to pickup was 6 minutes (interquartile range = 2-15 minutes). After controlling for the above factors, we found systematic and significant variation in the pickup time by chief complaint, with the longest times for patients with complaints of abdominal problems, numbness/tingling, and vaginal bleeding and shortest times for patients with ankle injury, allergic reaction, and wrist injury. Conclusions A consistent variation in resident pickup time exists for common chief complaints. We suspect that this reflects residents preferentially choosing patients with simpler workups and less perceived diagnostic ambiguity. This work introduces pickup time as a metric that may be useful in the future to uncover and address potential physician bias. Further work is necessary to establish whether practice patterns in this study are carried beyond residency and persist among attendings in the community and how these patterns are shaped by the information presented via the EHR.},

abstract = {We conduct an empirical investigation of the impact of queue management on patients' average wait time and length of stay (LOS). Using an emergency department's (ED) patient-level data from 2007 to 2010, we find that patients' average wait time and LOS are longer when physicians are assigned patients under a pooled queuing system with a fairness constraint compared to a dedicated queuing system with the same fairness constraint. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find the dedicated queuing system is associated with a 17\% decrease in average LOS and a 9\% decrease in average wait time relative to the control group—a 39-minute reduction in LOS and a four-minute reduction in wait time for an average patient of medium severity in this ED. Interviews and observations of physicians suggest that the improved performance stems from the physicians' increased ownership over patients and resources that is afforded by a dedicated queuing system, which enables physicians to more actively manage the flow of patients into and out of ED beds. Our findings suggest that the benefits from improved flow management in a dedicated queuing system can be large enough to overcome the longer wait time predicted to arise from nonpooled queues. We conduct additional analyses to rule out alternate explanations for the reduced average wait time and LOS in the dedicated system, such as stinting and decreased quality of care. Our paper has implications for healthcare organizations and others seeking to reduce patient wait time and LOS without increasing costs.},

Thus, it is difficult to predict inventory's effects on productivity a priori, inhibiting effective capacity management in high load systems. We categorize load into in-process inventory (congestion) and incoming inventory, decomposing the latter into its levels of bottleneck (BN) pressure and predictability, and quantify the magnitudes and directions of change on processing times. Using data from 283 hospitals, we find (1) high congestion increases a patient's hospital stay up to 28\%, indicating inefficiencies from overloaded resources; (2) a patient stays up to 11.7\% longer if there is a high load of incoming low BN pressure patients, consistent with the slowdown associated with “social loafing”; (3) a patient's stay is up to 10.2\% shorter when there is a high incoming load of predictable patients, consistent with workload smoothing.},

abstract = {We examine a large operational data set in a casual restaurant setting to study how coworkers' sales ability level affects other workers' sales performance. We find that waiters react nonlinearly to their coworkers' ability. In particular, when coworkers' overall sales ability is low, increasing this ability may prompt waiters to redouble both upselling and cross-selling efforts. When overall coworkers' ability is high, however, further increasing their ability may trigger waiters to reduce sales efforts. Our empirical findings imply that, to maximize sales, managers should mix waiters with heterogeneous ability levels during the same shift. Through a counterfactual analysis, we find that considering the inverted U-shaped peer effects when optimizing current waiters' schedules without changing their utilization may increase total sales by approximately 2.48\% at no extra cost.

In this paper, we combine an empirical investigation of the factors affecting nurse absenteeism rates with an analytical treatment of nurse staffing decisions using a novel variant of the newsvendor model. Using data from the emergency department of a large urban hospital, we find that absenteeism rates are consistent with nurses exhibiting an aversion to higher levels of anticipated workload. Using our empirical findings, we analyze a single-period nurse staffing problem considering both the case of constant absenteeism rate (exogenous absenteeism) as well as an absenteeism rate that is a function of the number of nurses scheduled (endogenous absenteeism). We provide characterizations of the optimal staffing levels in both situations and show that the failure to incorporate absenteeism as an endogenous effect results in understaffing.},

We use an exogenous shock-the implementation of labor scheduling software-and time-lagged instrumental variables to disentangle the endogeneity between demand and supply in this setting. We show that servers strive to maximize sales and speed efforts simultaneously, depending on the relative values of sales and speed. As a result, we find that, when the overall workload is small, servers expend more and more sales efforts with the increase in workload at a cost of slower service speed. However, above a certain workload threshold, servers start to reduce their sales efforts and work more promptly with the further rise in workload. In the focal restaurant chain, we find that this saturation point is currently not reached and, counterintuitively, the chain can reduce the staffing level and achieve both significantly higher sales (an estimated 3\% increase) and lower labor costs (an estimated 17\% decrease).},

Specifically, we study the multitasking behavior of physicians in a busy hospital emergency department (ED). By drawing on recent findings in the experimental psychology literature and the nascent work in cognitive neuroscience, we develop several hypotheses for the effect of multitasking on worker performance. We first examine how multitasking affects a physician's processing time. We find that the total time taken to discharge a given number of patients has a U-shaped response to the level of physician multitasking; that is, multitasking initially helps to reduce the time taken, but only up to a certain threshold level, after which it increases in the level of multitasking. In addition, multitasking significantly impacts quality of care. Although lower levels of multitasking are associated with improved quality...},

abstract = {Purpose-Assessing performance and quality in healthcare organisations is moving from focussing solely on clinical care measurement to considering the patient experience as critical. Much patient experience research is quantitative and survey based. The purpose of this paper is to report a qualitative study gathering in-depth data in an emergency department (ED). Design/methodology/approach-The authors used empirical data from seven focus groups to understand patient experience as participants progressed through a major teaching hospital in an Ireland ED. A convenience sampling technique was used, and 42 participants were invited to share their perceptions and outline key factors affecting their journey. A role-playing exercise was used to develop improvement themes. Data were analysed using thematic analysis and data analysis software (NVivo 10). Findings-Capturing ED patient experience increases our understanding and process impact on the patient journey. Factors identified include information, access, assurance, responsiveness and empathy, reliability and tangibles such as surroundings, food and seating. Research limitations/implications-Owing to the ED patient's emergency nature, participants were recruited if triaged at levels 3-5 (Manchester Triage System). The study explored patients' immediate rather than post hoc experiences where recollections may change over time. Originality/value-To the authors' knowledge, no study has examined in-depth, ED patient experience in Ireland using qualitative interviewing, obtaining critical process insights as it occurs. The potential to inform patient process improvements in Irish EDs is significant.},

We explore whether customer dissatisfaction follows a learning-curve pattern. Do organizations learn to reduce customer dissatisfaction? Customer dissatisfaction occurs when cus-tomers' ex ante expectations about a product or service exceed ex post perceptions about the product or service. Because customers can increase expectations over time, customer dissatisfaction may not decline even when the product or service improves. Consequently, it is an open question whether customer dissatisfaction follows a learning-curve pattern. Drawing from the literatures on learning curves and organizational learning, we hypothesize that customer dissatisfaction follows a U-shaped function of operating experience (Hypothesis 1), that focused airlines learn faster to reduce customer dissatisfaction than full-service airlines (Hypothesis 2), and that organizational learning curves for customer dissatisfaction are heterogeneous across airlines (Hypothesis 3). We test these hypotheses with quarterly data covering 1987 to 1998 on consumer complaints against the 10 largest U.S. airlines. We find strong support for Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 3. Hypothesis 2 is not supported in the sense that the average focused airline did not learn faster than the average full-service airline. However, we do find that the best focused airline learns faster than the best full-service airline. We explore this result by extending a knowledge-based view of managing productivity learning curves in factories to complaint learning curves in airlines.},

abstract = {Empirical studies of service systems have shown that workers exhibit different service rates depending on their assigned workload. In contrast, staffing models typically assume a constant service rate. To address this issue, we model two commonly observed behavioral effects, speedup and slowdown, in a general way that allows us to study their joint impact on service staffing. We fit our behavioral model to a hospital dataset and show that both effects are present across a variety of departments. Given these findings, we incorporate speedup and slowdown behavior into a multiperiod workforce staffing model and show that a workload (defined as the number of jobs assigned to each worker) that maximizes the service rate is typically not optimal. As expected, the effectiveness of the widely practiced single-ratio workload staffing policy depends on the strength of the speedup and slowdown effects. Interestingly, we find that in the presence of slowdown, weak behavioral effects (where workers work at a relatively constant rate) are the cases where the single-ratio policy performs the worst; the optimal workload instead varies the most as system demand changes. This result differs from practice in many services such as healthcare, where fixed patient-to-nurse ratio workloads are commonly used. We show that the strength of behavioral effects modulates the trade-off between a steady workload and the number of schedule adjustments.},

abstract = {Objectives: To determine the degree of telemedicine expansion overall and across patient subpopulations and diagnoses. We hypothesized that telemedicine visits would increase substantially due to the need for continuity of care despite the disruptive effects of COVID-19. Study Design: A retrospective study of health insurance claims for telemedicine visits from January 1, 2018, through March 10, 2020 (prepandemic period), and March 11, 2020, through October 31, 2020 (pandemic period). Methods: We analyzed claims from 1,589,777 telemedicine visits that were submitted to Independence Blue Cross (Independence) from telemedicine-only providers and providers who traditionally deliver care in person. The primary exposure was the combination of individual behavior changes, state stay-at-home orders, and the Independence expansion of billing policies for telemedicine. The comparison population consisted of telemedicine visits in the prepandemic period. Results: Telemedicine increased rapidly from a mean (SD) of 773 (155) weekly visits in prepandemic 2020 to 45,632 (19,937) weekly visits in the pandemic period. During the pandemic period, a greater proportion of telemedicine users were older, had Medicare Advantage insurance plans, had existing chronic conditions, or resided in predominantly non-Hispanic Black or African American Census tracts compared with during the prepandemic period. A significant increase in telemedicine claims containing a mental health–related diagnosis was observed. Conclusions: Telemedicine expanded rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic across a broad range of clinical conditions and demographics. Although levels declined later in 2020, telemedicine utilization remained markedly higher than 2019 and 2018 levels. Trends suggest that telemedicine will likely play a key role in postpandemic care delivery.},

For more information on INFORMS, its publications, membership, or meetings visit Abstract. Problem definition: This study addresses three important questions concerning the effectiveness of stay-at-home orders and sociodemographic disparities. (1) What is the average effect of the orders on the percentage of residents staying at home? (2) Is the effect heterogeneous across counties with different percentages of vulnerable populations (defined as those without health insurance or who did not attend high school)? (3) If so, why are the orders less effective for some counties than for others? Academic/practical relevance: To combat the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a number of states in the United States implemented stay-at-home orders that prevent residents from leaving their homes except for essential trips. These orders have drawn heavy criticism from the public because whether they are necessary and effective in increasing the number of residents staying at home is unclear. Methodology: We estimate the average effect of the orders using a difference-indifferences model, where the control group is the counties that did not implement the orders and the treatment group is the counties that did implement the orders during our study period. We estimate the heterogeneous effects of the orders by interacting county features with treatment dummies in a triple-difference model. Results: Using a unique set of mobile device data that track residents' mobility, we find that, although some residents already voluntarily stayed at home before the implementation of any order, the stay-at-home orders increased the number of residents staying at home by 2.832 percentage points (or 11.25\%). We also find that these orders are less effective for counties with higher percentages of uninsured or less educated (i.e., did not attend high school) residents. To explore the mechanisms behind these results, we analyze the effect of the orders on the average number of work and nonwork trips per person. We find that the orders reduce the number of work trips by 0.053 (or 7.87\%) and nonwork trips by 0.183 (or 6.50\%). The percentage of uninsured or less educated residents in a county negatively correlates with the reduction in the number of work trips but does not correlate with the reduction in the number of nonwork trips. Managerial implications: Our results suggest that uninsured and less educated residents are less likely to follow the orders because their jobs prevent them from working from home. Policy makers must take into account the differences in residents' socioeconomic status when developing new policies or allocating limited healthcare resources.

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Parents hesitant to vaccinate their children may delay routine immunizations or seek exemptions from state vaccine mandates. Recent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States have drawn attention to this phenomenon. Improved understanding of the association between vaccine refusal and the epidemiology of these diseases is needed. OBJECTIVE To review the published literature to evaluate the association between vaccine delay, refusal, or exemption and the epidemiology of measles and pertussis, 2 vaccine-preventable diseases with recent US outbreaks. EVIDENCE REVIEW Search of PubMed through November 30, 2015, for reports of US measles outbreaks that have occurred since measles was declared eliminated in the United States (after January 1, 2000), endemic and epidemic pertussis since the lowest point in US pertussis incidence (after January 1, 1977), and for studies that assessed disease risk in the context of vaccine delay or exemption. FINDINGS We identified 18 published measles studies (9 annual summaries and 9 outbreak reports), which described 1416 measles cases (individual age range, 2 weeks-84 years; 178 cases younger than 12 months) and more than half (56.8\%) had no history of measles vaccination. Of the 970 measles cases with detailed vaccination data, 574 cases were unvaccinated despite being vaccine eligible and 405 (70.6\%) of these had nonmedical exemptions (eg, exemptions for religious or philosophical reasons, as opposed to medical contraindications; 41.8\%of total). Among 32 reports of pertussis outbreaks, which included 10 609 individuals for whom vaccination status was reported (age range, 10 days-87 years), the 5 largest statewide epidemics had substantial proportions (range, 24\%-45\%) of unvaccinated or undervaccinated individuals. However, several pertussis outbreaks also occurred in highly vaccinated populations, indicating waning immunity. Nine reports (describing 12 outbreaks) provided detailed vaccination data on unimmunized cases; among 8 of these outbreaks from 59\%through 93\%of unvaccinated individuals were intentionally unvaccinated. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A substantial proportion of the US measles cases in the era after elimination were intentionally unvaccinated. The phenomenon of vaccine refusal was associated with an increased risk for measles among people who refuse vaccines and among fully vaccinated individuals. Although pertussis resurgence has been attributed to waning immunity and other factors, vaccine refusal was still associated with an increased risk for pertussis in some populations.},

We reviewed several nationally representative public opinion polls that we and others have conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic to examine whether households with serious medical problems were able to get care they needed during this time. Among those unable to get care, we also assessed whether it was because of financial reasons (including insurance) or other issues.},

abstract = {Vaccine hesitancy reflects concerns about the decision to vaccinate oneself or one's children. There is a broad range of factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy, including the compulsory nature of vaccines, their coincidental temporal relationships to adverse health outcomes, unfamiliarity with vaccine-preventable diseases, and lack of trust in corporations and public health agencies. Although vaccination is a norm in the U.S. and the majority of parents vaccinate their children, many do so amid concerns. The proportion of parents claiming non-medical exemptions to school immunization requirements has been increasing over the past decade. Vaccine refusal has been associated with outbreaks of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b disease, varicella, pneumococcal disease, measles, and pertussis, resulting in the unnecessary suffering of young children and waste of limited public health resources. Vaccine hesitancy is an extremely important issue that needs to be addressed because effective control of vaccine-preventable diseases generally requires indefinite maintenance of extremely high rates of timely vaccination. The multifactorial and complex causes of vaccine hesitancy require a broad range of approaches on the individual, provider, health system, and national levels. These include standardized measurement tools to quantify and locate clustering of vaccine hesitancy and better understand issues of trust; rapid, independent, and transparent review of an enhanced and appropriately funded vaccine safety system; adequate reimbursement for vaccine risk communication in doctors' offices; and individually tailored messages for parents who have vaccine concerns, especially first-time pregnant women. The potential of vaccines to prevent illness and save lives has never been greater. Yet, that potential is directly dependent on parental acceptance of vaccines, which requires confidence in vaccines, healthcare providers who recommend and administer vaccines, and the systems to make sure vaccines are safe.},

On average, the number of outpatient visits (inpatient admissions) decreased by 18\% (9\%) after COVID­19 outbreak. Furthermore, the demand response of healthcare for infectious diseases (e.g. flu) is much greater and more persistent than for other diseases, suggesting that the substantial decline in healthcare use is induced by positive public­health externality of prevention measures for COVID­19.},

Then, using daily state-level coronavirus case data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we find that approximately three weeks following the adoption of a SIPO, cumulative COVID-19 cases fell by 44 percent. Event-study analyses confirm common COVID-19 case trends in the week prior to SIPO adoption and show that SIPO-induced case reductions grew larger over time. However, this average effect masks important heterogeneity across states-early adopters and high population density states appear to reap larger benefits from their SIPOs. Finally, we find that statewide SIPOs were associated with a reduction in coronavirus-related deaths, but estimated mortality effects were imprecisely estimated.},

abstract = {We combine structural estimation with ideas from Machine Learning to estimate a model with information-based voluntary social distancing and state lockdowns to analyze the factors driving the effect of social distancing in mitigating COVID-19. The model allows us to estimate how contagious social interactions are by state and enables us to control for several unobservable, time-varying confounders such as asymptomatic transmission, sample selection in testing and quarantining, and time-varying fatality rates. We find that information-based voluntary social distancing has saved three times as many lives as lockdowns. Second, information policy effects are asymmetric: 'least informed' responses would have implied 240,000 more fatalities by June 2020 while 'most informed' responses would have saved 25,000 more lives. Third, our estimates suggest that contagion externalities from social interactions are large enough that a lockdown response could have been 25\% less costly for the median state and still saved an equivalent number of lives.},

abstract = {Voluntary shelter-in-place directives and lockdowns are the main non-pharmaceutical interventions that governments around the globe have used to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. In this paper we study the impact of such interventions in the capital of a developing country, Santiago, Chile, that exhibits large socioeconomic inequality. A distinctive feature of our study is that we use granular geolocated mobile phone data to construct mobility measures that capture (1) shelter-in-place behavior, and (2) trips within the city to destinations with potentially different risk profiles. Using panel data linear regression models we first show that the impact of social distancing measures and lockdowns on mobility is highly heterogeneous and dependent on socioeconomic levels. More specifically , our estimates indicate that while zones of high socioeconomic levels can exhibit reductions in mobility of around 50\% to 90\% depending on the specific mobility metric used, these reductions are only 20\% to 50\% for lower-income communities. The large reductions in higher-income communities are significantly driven by voluntary shelter-in-place behavior. Second, also using panel data methods we show that our mobility measures are important predictors of infections: a 10\% increase in mobility correlates with approximately a 5\% increase in the rate of infection. Our results suggest that mobility is an important factor explaining differences in infections rates between high and low incomes areas within the city. Further, they confirm the challenges of reducing mobility in lower-income communities, where people generate their income from their daily work. To be effective, shelter-in-place restrictions in municipalities of low socioeconomic levels may need to be complemented by other supporting measures that enable their inhabitants to increase compliance.},

abstract = {There is a growing trend in the retail industry to improve customer experience. In this article, we study retailer-initiated strategies to increase consumer valuation for a product under duopoly. In such a setting, it is possible that a consumer's valuation may be increased by one retailer; however, the consumer may decide to buy the product from the competitor. We consider a two-stage game where retailers first decide whether to invest in improvements in customer valuation and then engage in price competition. We computationally explore the Nash equilibria in terms of both investment and pricing. We find that in the majority of cases retailers price in a manner to discourage their local customers to buy from the competitor. Next, we focus on the pricing game and theoretically characterize the pricing Nash equilibrium. We find that a retailer could overcome competitive effects by improving consumer valuation beyond a certain threshold. We also find that a retailer who does not invest could benefit from competition in situations where his competitor increases consumer valuation beyond a threshold. Finally, we explore through a computational study the Nash equilibria of the two-stage game using an alternate model to establish the robustness of our findings. {\textcopyright} 2013 Production and Operations Management Society.},

abstract = {Within the frame of decision aid literature, decision making problems with multiple sources of information have drawn the attention of researchers from a wide spectrum of disciplines. In decision situations with multiple individuals, each one has his own knowledge on the alternatives of the decision problem. The use of information assessed in different domains is not a seldom situation. This non-homogeneous information can be represented as values belonging to domains with different nature as linguistic, numerical and interval valued or can be values assessed in label sets with different granularity, multi-granular linguistic information. Decision processes for solving these problems are composed by two phases: aggregation and exploitation. The main problem to deal with non-homogeneous contexts is how to aggregate the information assessed in these contexts? In this paper, taking as base the 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation model we shall develop an aggregation process for dealing with non-homogeneous contexts. In first place, we shall develop an aggregation process for combining numerical, interval valued and linguistic information, afterwards we shall propose different extensions of this process to deal with contexts in which can appear other type of information as intuitionistic fuzzy sets or multi-granular linguistic information.},

Two main classes of problems and issues are discussed. The first comprises issues relating to the quantity and diversity of information available: information overload, information anxiety, etc. The second comprises issues relating to the changing information environment with the advent of Web 2.0: loss of identity and authority, emphasis on micro-chunking and shallow novelty, and the impermanence of information.

abstract = {Financial markets and macroeconomic environments are often characterised by positive external-ities. In these environments, transparency may reduce expected welfare: public announcements serve as focal points for higher-order beliefs and affect agents{\~{O}} behaviour more than justified by their informational contents. Some scholars conclude that reducing public signals{\~{O}} precision or entirely withholding information may improve welfare. This article shows that public information should always be provided with maximum precision but, under certain conditions, not to all agents. Restricting the degree of publicity is a better-suited instrument for preventing the negative welfare effects of public announcements than restrictions on their precision are. There is a general presumption that higher central bank transparency in terms of information disclosure to a wider audience improves the effectiveness of monetary policy and is beneficial to markets as it reduces information asymmetries, helps to assess risk better and arrive at more informed decisions, thus enhancing market efficiency. While practitioners (in central banks and international institutions) agree on the desirability of informative announcements and promote higher transparency on the ground that any information is valuable to markets, recent academic literature distinguishes private and public information and argues that public announcements may destabilise markets and reduce efficiency by their effects on higher-order beliefs, if markets are characterised by positive externalities. Morris and Shin (2002) (henceforth M-S) have shown that noisy public announcements may be detrimental to welfare from an ex ante point of view. They conclude that a commitment to withholding relevant information or deliberately reducing its precision may be welfare enhancing. In this article we challenge this conclusion by distinguishing two components of transparency: precision of information and degree of publicity. The degree of publicity is the proportion of agents who receive a signal. Using a stylised coordination game introduced by M-S, we show that information should always be provided to the market with maximum precision but, under certain conditions, the mechanisms of disseminating information should aim at limiting the degree of publicity by providing information only to some fraction of market participants. The optimal degree of publicity depends on the precision of announcements. If there are inevitable limits to the precision, the optimal degree of publicity is rising in precision and reaches one if precision is sufficiently high. The rationale for our results is that partial publicity increases expected utility for those who receive the information, while potentially detrimental effects on higher-order beliefs are limited if agents expect that others do not possess the same information. The literature distinguishes at least three different lines of arguments against central bank transparency. Within a Barro-Gordon framework, the inflation bias may be},

We survey the literature to understand how information type influences the continued evolution of financial markets and institutions. Information is an essential component in all financial transactions and markets. A major purpose of financial markets and institutions is to collect, process, and transmit information. Given the importance of information and its transmission to the study of finance, as technology changes the way information is communicated, it also fundamentally changes financial markets, securities, and institutions, especially financial intermediaries.

While cost of labor is well understood, the revenue implications of having the right staffing level are hard to estimate. Moreover, these implications vary by store; hence, staffing levels should vary as well. Academic/practical relevance: We provide a novel method for setting store associate staffing at the individual store level. We discuss a field implementation that tested this methodology. Methodology: We use historical data on revenue and planned and actual staffing levels by store to estimate how revenue varies with the staffing level at each store. We disentangle the endogeneity between revenue and staffing levels by focusing on randomly occurring deviations between planned and actual labor. Using historical analysis as a guide, we validate these results by changing the staffing levels in a few test stores. We implement the results chain-wide and measure the impact in a large specialty retailer. Results: We find that the implementation validates predictions of the historical analysis. The implementation in 168 stores over six months produces a 4.5\% revenue increase and a nearly \$7.4 million annual profit increase. The impact of staffing level on revenue varies greatly by store. Managerial implications: Our paper makes three contributions to academic literature and to retail practice. First, we describe a process by which retailers can improve the most common industry practice: set store labor to be proportional to forecasted store revenue. Our proposed approach systematically sets the labor level in each store. Second, we demonstrate the effectiveness of that process via a field test and then via chain-wide implementation over a six-month time period. Finally, most retailers set store labor at the same level across stores, proportionate to revenue. We show that this is not the best approach because the revenue impact of store labor varies by store. The stores in our study that could benefit from relatively more labor were those with high potential demand, closely located competition for that demand, and experienced store managers. Overall, we provide the first simple but rigorous, field-tested approach that any retailer can use to increase revenue and profitability through better labor management.},

Problem definition: We consider the development of an efficient and scalable video-analytics approach to measure customer assistance and its mediating role in the relationship between staffing levels and revenues. Academic/practical relevance: Staffing decisions account for a large portion of a retailer's operational costs. Researchers have studied the extent to which an increase in staffing levels translates into greater revenues, without emphasizing the underlying mechanisms that generate this potential improvement , such as assisting customers. Methodology: We use econometric methods, including survival-analysis techniques, to analyze data gathered from in-store video recordings of customer visits to stores of a women's apparel chain. Results: We find that, under average store conditions, a 25\% increase in labor yields a 16\% increase in store revenues. An increase in the assistance of customers while searching, browsing, or trying products mediates approximately 50\% of this increase, while the remainder originates from other activities, such as helping customers at the checkout counter. Moreover, we find that this form of assistance has a significant and positive impact on both conversion and ticket size. Managerial implications: Our approach can be used to explain heterogeneity in employee productivity across stores, to monitor and detect unexpected deviations in customer-assistance levels, and to measure the productivity of multitasking agents for the different functions that they perform.

abstract = {The performance of a retail store depends on its ability to attract customer traffic, match labor with incoming traffic, and convert the incoming traffic into sales. Retailers make significant investments in marketing activities (such as advertising) to bring customers into their stores and in-store labor to convert that traffic into sales. Thus, a common trade-off that retail store managers face concerns the allocation of a store's limited budget between advertising and labor to enhance store-level sales. To explore that trade-off, we develop a centralized model to allocate limited store budget between store labor and advertising with the objective of maximizing store sales. We find that a store's inherent potential to drive traffic plays an important role, among other factors, in the relative allocation between advertising and store labor. We also find that as advertising instruments become more effective in bringing traffic to stores, managers should not always capitalize this effectiveness by increasing their existing allocations to advertising. In addition, we discuss a decentralized setting where budget allocation decisions cannot be enforced by a store manager and present a simple mechanism that can achieve the centralized solution. In an extension, we address the budget allocation problem in the presence of marketing efforts to shift store traffic from peak to off peak hours and show that our initial findings are robust. Further, we illustrate how the solution from the budget allocation model can be used to facilitate store level sales force planning/scheduling decisions. Based on the results of our model, we present several insights that can help managers in budget allocation and sales force planning.},

Using an empirical model motivated from queueing theory, we calculate the benchmark staffing level for each store, and establish the presence of systematic understaffing during peak hours. We find that all 41 stores in our sample are systematically understaffed during a 3-hour peak period. Eliminating understaffing in these stores can result in a significant increase in sales and profitability in these stores. Also, we examine the extent to which forecasting errors and scheduling constraints drive understaffing in retail stores and quantify their relative impacts on store profits for the retailer in our study.},

This work develops a decision support tool to manage staffing levels and schedule working shifts, balancing the sales contribution of employees with salary costs. We extend recent empirical studies that estimate the impact of staffing levels on sales, combining detailed sales transaction and hourly customer traffic with employee staffing data. The empirical strategy uses exogenous deviations between the planned and actual schedule to identify the causal effect of staffing on conversion rates and basket value. This empirical model combined with traffic forecasting models are used as an input to a scheduling algorithm that optimizes the workforce schedule by balancing revenues with employee salaries, providing a feasible and detailed specification of working shifts that complies with labor regulations and other practical constraints. We also propose a robust optimization model to face uncertainties coming from the parameter estimation. The methodology is tested using real data from a children apparel retail chain in Latin America. The results suggest that most stores are understaffed during the weekends and at the same time overstaffed during lunch hours in weekdays, which is in part explained by the reduced flexibility imposed by regulatory restrictions for full-time workers.

abstract = {Staffing decisions are crucial for retailers since staffing levels affect store performance and labor-related expenses constitute one of the largest components of retailers' operating costs. With the goal of improving staffing decisions and store performance, we develop a labor-planning framework using proprietary data from an apparel retail chain. First, we propose a sales response function based on labor adequacy (the labor to traffic ratio) that exhibits variable elasticity of substitution between traffic and labor. When compared to a frequently used function with constant elasticity of substitution, our proposed function exploits information content from data more effectively and better predicts sales under extreme labor/traffic conditions. We use the validated sales response function to develop a data-driven staffing heuristic that incorporates the prediction loss function and uses past traffic to predict optimal labor. In counterfactual experimentation, we show that profits achieved by our heuristic are within 0.5\% of the optimal (attainable if perfect traffic information was available) under stable traffic conditions, and within 2.5\% of the optimal under extreme traffic variability. We conclude by discussing implications of our findings for researchers and practitioners.},

Problem definition: Brick-and-mortar (B and M) retailers must enhance the customer in-store experience to better compete with online retailers. Fitting rooms in B and M stores play a critical role in the customer experience as a venue to experience products and examine alternatives. High traffic in fitting rooms, however, obstructs the customer's ability to choose a product. In this paper, we (1) examine the impact of fitting room traffic on store performance using archival data, (2) identify phantom stockouts as a plausible mechanism for this impact, and (3) provide a potential solution and quantify the magnitude of its impact using two field experiments. Academic/practical relevance: The consumer purchase decision process framework has been widely used in disciplines such as marketing and information systems. We consider the impact of high traffic in fitting rooms on customer's purchase decision process. We show that high traffic in fitting rooms affects store sales negatively as it can obstruct customers' ability to perform information search, evaluation of alternatives, or both. Methodology: We use archival data analysis, a field study, and a field experiment to demonstrate our findings. Results: We demonstrate an inverted-U relationship between fitting room traffic and sales using archival data analysis. Our field study reveals that high traffic in fitting rooms exacerbates phantom stockouts, which could contribute to the decline in sales. Finally, through field experiments at two retailers, we show that a timely backend recovery operation through a dedicated fitting room associate reduces phantom stockouts and increases sales by 22.4\%-22.7\%. Managerial implications: First, contrary to conventional wisdom that traffic drives sales, we identify that fitting room traffic beyond a certain point can hurt store sales. Second, we find a large magnitude of phantom stockouts in fitting rooms. Finally, we show that dedicated fitting room labor can significantly boost store sales by alleviating phantom stockouts. Our proposed solution was adopted by both retail organizations that we worked with. Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2020.0884.},

The implementation of this project is associated with a reduction in online sales and an increase in store sales and traffic. These results can be explained by two simultaneous phenomena: (1) additional store sales from customers who use the BOPS functionality and buy additional products in the stores (cross-selling effect) and (2) the shift of some customers from the online to the brick-and-mortar channel and the conversion of noncustomers into store customers (channel-shift effect). We explain these channel-shift patterns as an increase in "research online, purchase offline" behavior enabled by BOPS implementation, and we validate this explanation with evidence from the change of cart abandonment and conversion rates of the brick-and-mortar and online channels. We interpret these results in light of recent operations management literature that analyzes the impact of sharing inventory availability information.

abstract = {Our framework for understanding advice-taking in decision making rests on two theoretical concepts that motivate the studies and serve to explain the findings. The first is egocentric discounting of others' opinions and the second is reputation formation for advisors. Advice discounting is attributed to differential information, namely, the notion that decision makers have privileged access to their internal reasons for holding their own opinion , but not to the advisors' internal reasons. Reputation formation is related to the negativity effect in impression formation and to the trust asymmetry principle. In three studies we measured decision makers' weighting policy for advice and, in a fourth study, their willingness to pay for it. Briefly, we found that advice is discounted relative to one's own opinion, while advisors' reputations are rapidly formed and asymmetrically revised. The asymmetry implies that it may be easier for advisors to lose a good reputation than to gain one. The cognitive and social origins of these phenomena are considered. Taking advice is a central component of realistic decision making, since decision problems generally do not come as complete textbook problems with the relevant information as givens. Instead, decision makers engage in interactive processes in order to build the relevant informational basis. In particular, they solicit the opinions of worthy advisors, assess the merit of each opinion, and combine them. Examples include asking a fellow bus passenger about a street address, consulting a colleague's opinion for a research project, and genetic counseling regarding reproductive decisions.

abstract = {Demand forecasting is a crucial aspect of the planning process in supply-chain companies. The most common approach to forecasting demand in these companies involves the use of a computerized forecasting system to produce initial forecasts and the subsequent judgmental adjustment of these forecasts by the company's demand planners, ostensibly to take into account exceptional circumstances expected over the planning horizon. Making these adjustments can involve considerable management effort and time, but do they improve accuracy, and are some types of adjustment more effective than others? To investigate this, we collected data on more than 60,000 forecasts and outcomes from four supply-chain companies. In three of the companies, on average, judgmental adjustments increased accuracy. However, a detailed analysis revealed that, while the relatively larger adjustments tended to lead to greater average improvements in accuracy, the smaller adjustments often damaged accuracy. In addition, positive adjustments, which involved adjusting the forecast upwards, were much less likely to improve accuracy than negative adjustments. They were also made in the wrong direction more frequently, suggesting a general bias towards optimism. Models were then developed to eradicate such biases. Based on both this statistical analysis and organisational observation, the paper goes on to analyse strategies designed to enhance the effectiveness of judgmental adjustments directly.},

abstract = {Recent research has suggested that consumers have in-store slack for grocery trips-that is, they leave room in their mental budgets to make unplanned purchases. Drawing on this work, this article examines how the impact of promotions depends on whether the shopper still has in-store slack remaining in his or her mental budget. Specifically, the authors evaluate how the effect of promotional savings for both planned and unplanned items on spending varies as a function of whether the item is purchased before or after the shopper's in-store slack is depleted. In addition, they examine how these relationships vary depending on income. To achieve these goals, the authors conducted a field study in which respondents used a handheld scanner to record the order of purchases. The results suggest that savings on planned items lead to stockpiling by higher-income shoppers when the savings occur before the in-store slack has been depleted but lead to increased purchase of unplanned items when they occur after in-store slack is depleted. The results also show that promotions on unplanned grocery items generate incremental spending at the basket level, which increases with income but only when the item is purchased after the in-store slack is exceeded. The authors discuss implications for shopper marketing strategies.},

abstract = {We develop results for the use of Lasso and Post-Lasso methods to form first-stage predictions and estimate optimal instruments in linear instrumental variables (IV) models with many instruments, $p$. Our results apply even when $p$ is much larger than the sample size, $n$. We show that the IV estimator based on using Lasso or Post-Lasso in the first stage is root-n consistent and asymptotically normal when the first-stage is approximately sparse; i.e. when the conditional expectation of the endogenous variables given the instruments can be well-approximated by a relatively small set of variables whose identities may be unknown. We also show the estimator is semi-parametrically efficient when the structural error is homoscedastic. Notably our results allow for imperfect model selection, and do not rely upon the unrealistic "beta-min" conditions that are widely used to establish validity of inference following model selection. In simulation experiments, the Lasso-based IV estimator with a data-driven penalty performs well compared to recently advocated many-instrument-robust procedures. In an empirical example dealing with the effect of judicial eminent domain decisions on economic outcomes, the Lasso-based IV estimator outperforms an intuitive benchmark. In developing the IV results, we establish a series of new results for Lasso and Post-Lasso estimators of nonparametric conditional expectation functions which are of independent theoretical and practical interest. We construct a modification of Lasso designed to deal with non-Gaussian, heteroscedastic disturbances which uses a data-weighted $\ell_1$-penalty function. Using moderate deviation theory for self-normalized sums, we provide convergence rates for the resulting Lasso and Post-Lasso estimators that are as sharp as the corresponding rates in the homoscedastic Gaussian case under the condition that $\log p = o(n^{1/3})$.},

Although research and analyses have attempted to draw important lessons on how to strengthen pandemic preparedness and response, few have examined the effect that fragmented governance for health has had on effectively mitigating the crisis. By assessing the ability of health systems to manage COVID-19 from the perspective of two key approaches to global health policy-global health security and universal health coverage-important lessons can be drawn for how to align varied priorities and objectives in strengthening health systems. This Health Policy paper compares three types of health systems (ie, with stronger investments in global health security, stronger investments in universal health coverage, and integrated investments in global health security and universal health coverage) in their response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and synthesises four essential recommendations (ie, integration, financing, resilience, and equity) to reimagine governance, policies, and investments for better health towards a more sustainable future.},

We find that an increase in the Twitter index of social distancing on day t-1 is associated with a decrease in mobility on day t. We also find that state orders, an increase in the number of COVID cases, precipitation and temperature contribute to reducing human mobility. Republican states are also less likely to enforce social distancing. Beliefs shared on social networks could both reveal the behavior of individuals and influence the behavior of others. Our findings suggest that policy makers can use geotagged Twitter data-in conjunction with mobility data-to better understand individual voluntary social distancing actions.},

abstract = {The U.S. health care system has experienced great pressure since early March 2020 as it pivoted to providing necessary care for COVID-19 patients. But there are signs that non-COVID-19 care use declined during this time period. We examine near real time data from a nationwide electronic healthcare records system that covers over 35 million patients to provide new evidence of how non-COVID-19 acute care and preventive/primary care have been affected during the epidemic. Using event study and difference-indifference models we find that state closure policies (stay-at-home or non-essential business closures) are associated with large declines in ambulatory visits, with effects differing by type of care. State closure policies reduced overall outpatient visits by about 15-16 percent within two weeks. Outpatient visits for health checkups and well care experience very large declines during the epidemic, with substantial effects from state closure policies. In contrast, mental health outpatient visits declined less than other care, and appear less affected by state closure policies. We find substitution to telehealth modalities may have played an important role in mitigating the decline in mental health care utilization. Aggregate trends in outpatient visits show a 40\% decline after the first week of March 2020, only a portion of which is attributed to state policy. A rebound starts around mid April that does not appear to be explained by state reopening policy. Despite this rebound, care visits still remain below the pre-epidemic levels in most cases.},

abstract = {For much of 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic upended social and economic life globally. In an effort to reduce COVID-19 risks in the U.S., state and local governments issued many recommendations and regulations to induce social distancing, adding to voluntary reductions in interpersonal contact. The responses to the epidemic helped contain spread, but also lead to high unintended societal costs. In the summer months, states took steps to revive the economy and lift social distancing regulations. However, as many epidemiologists expected, the scale of the epidemic has expanded very rapidly in the fall. In the week of October 14, the US generated around 57,000 new COVID-19 cases and 700 deaths each day. By November 15, the country was generating about 151,000 new cases and 1,200 deaths per day. These rapid increases in cases and deaths raise concerns about the capacity of local healthcare systems around the country. State governments are once again facing difficult choices about whether and how to use policies to address the spread of the virus. The incoming Biden-Harris administration faces an important challenge in trying to manage the epidemic as well as a large scale vaccination campaign. Although the epidemic is less than a year old, it has generated a huge volume of research by economists, epidemiologists, and others. This body of work may help inform policy decisions facing society in the coming months. In this paper, we make five broad contributions. First, we provide a concise review of economic and social science research on mobility patterns, labor market outcomes, consumer behavior, and population health during the first phase of the epidemic. Second, we sketch a simple microeconomic model that may be useful considering the determinants of social distancing and the role of different policy instruments in promoting distancing. Third, we present a simple typology of the policies that were used at the state and county levels during the closure and reopening phases of the epidemic in the U.S.. Fourth, we review a collection of new data sources that have played an important role in monitoring and analyzing population behavior this year. Fifth, we present results from event study regressions that try to disentangle private vs. policy-induced changes in mobility patterns during the early part of the epidemic.},

In the face of a pandemic, individuals adjust their behavior, whereas in SIR models infection rates are typically exogenous.

Incorporating experimentally validated measures of social preferences at the regional level, we find that stringency measures matter less when individuals are more patient, altruistic, or exhibit less negative reciprocity. To account for these findings, we extend homogeneous and networked SIR models by endogenizing agents' social-activity intensity and incorporating social preferences. Our quantitative predictions markedly differ from those of the na{\"{i}}ve SIR network model. We derive the planner's problem, and show that neglecting agents' endogenous response leads to misguided policy decisions of various non-pharmaceutical interventions.

abstract = {The collapse of economic activity in 2020 from COVID-19 has been immense. An important question is how much of that collapse resulted from government-imposed restrictions versus people voluntarily choosing to stay home to avoid infection. This paper examines the drivers of the economic slowdown using cellular phone records data on customer visits to more than 2.25 million individual businesses across 110 different industries. Comparing consumer behavior over the crisis within the same commuting zones but across state and county boundaries with different policy regimes suggests that legal shutdown orders account for only a modest share of the massive changes to consumer behavior (and that tracking county-level policy conditions is significantly more accurate than using state-level policies alone). While overall consumer traffic fell by 60 percentage points, legal restrictions explain only 7 percentage points of this. Individual choices were far more important and seem tied to fears of infection. Traffic started dropping before the legal orders were in place; was highly influenced by the number of COVID deaths reported in the county; and showed a clear shift by consumers away from busier, more crowded stores toward smaller, less busy stores in the same industry. States that repealed their shutdown orders saw symmetric, modest recoveries in consumer visits, further supporting the small estimated effect of policy. Although the shutdown orders had little aggregate impact, they did have a significant effect in reallocating consumer visits away from ''nonessential" to ''essential" businesses and from restaurants and bars toward groceries and other food sellers. {\'{O}} 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V. The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its associated COVID-19 disease has had unprecedented effects on economic activity around the world. In an effort to limit the spread of the disease, many governments adopted stay-at-home/shelter-in-place orders. That ignited a debate over ''re-opening" and whether the health benefits from the orders' impact on slowing the spread of the virus outweighed the economic damage they did. It is not clear, however, that the economic decline actually came from the lockdown orders. Those lockdown orders were an endogenous policy response to the arrival of the disease. By many accounts, anxious individuals engaged in physical distancing on their own accord and understanding the size of that effect is critical for evaluating the policy question. If fear rather than policy drives the economics, the economic stimulus from repealing the orders may be considerably smaller than some might predict. In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of government policy on the economy during the initial spread of COVID-19 in the U. S. using data on foot traffic at 2.25 million individual businesses. Our empirical strategy separates the effects of voluntary distancing from that of policy orders by comparing differences in foot traffic across businesses within commuting zones that span jurisdictions facing differing legal restrictions. This leverages two related types of variation: businesses in border-spanning commuting zones where jurisdictions impose of shelter-in-place orders at different times (e.g., northern Illinois when Illinois placed a sheltering order on March 20th while Wisconsin waited until the following week), and businesses in commuting zones where a jurisdiction never imposed an order (e.g., the Quad Cities area, where the Illinois towns of Moline and Rock Island faced stay-at-home orders but bordering Davenport and Bettendorf, Iowa did not).},

abstract = {PURPOSE This study was conducted to document current immunization practices by family physicians. METHODS In 2008 the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) conducted a survey among a random sample of 2,000 of its members who reported spending 80\% or more of their time in direct patient care. The survey consisted of questions regarding the demographics of the practice, vaccines that are provided at the physicians' clinical site, whether the practice refers patients elsewhere for vaccines, and participation in the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program. RESULTS The response rate was 38.5\%, 31.8\% after non-offi ce-based respondents were deleted. A high proportion of respondents (80\% or more) reported providing most routinely recommended child, adolescent, and adult vaccines at their practice sites. The exceptions were rotavirus vaccine for children and herpes zoster vaccine for adults., A signifi cant proportion, however, reported referring elsewhere for some vaccines (44.1\% for children and adolescent vaccines and 53.5\% for adult vaccines), with the most frequent referral location being a public health department. A higher proportion of solo and 2-physician practices than larger practices reported referring patients. A lack of adequate payment was listed as the reason for referring patients elsewhere for vaccines by one-half of those who refer patients. One-half of responders do not participate in the VFC program. CONCLUSIONS Provision of recommended vaccines by most family physicians remains an important service. Smaller practices have more diffi culty offering a full array of vaccine products, and lack of adequate payment contributes to referring patients outside the medical home. The reasons behind the lack of participation in the VFC program deserve further study.},

abstract = {Background: Family physicians (FPs) play an important role in influenza vaccination. We investigated how local FP supply is associated with influenza vaccination, controlling for both individual-level and county-level characteristics. Methods: The 2008-2010 individual-level data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were merged with county-level data from the Area Resource File (n ¼ 985,157). Multivariate logistic analyses were performed to predict influenza vaccination using the number of FPs per 1000 population as the key predictor, adjusting for individual-level demographic, socioeconomic, and health information, as well as county-level racial composition and income level. Additional analyses were performed across racial/ ethnic and employment status categories. Results: Increasing local FP supply was associated with higher odds (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.58; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.49-1.67) and varied across racial/ethnic groups (Hispanic: aOR, 2.05, 95\% CI, 1.55-2.72; non-Hispanic white: aOR, 1.57, 95\% CI, 1.48-1.66; non-Hispanic black: aOR, 1.49, 95\% CI, 1.18-1.89), employment status categories, and county types. Conclusions: FP supply was significantly associated with influenza vaccination. The association was greatest among those who were Hispanic, residing in a rural area, or out of work. Our findings lend support to initiatives aimed at increasing the FP supply, particularly among disadvantaged populations. Influenza vaccination is a cost-effective preventive service 1-3 and a core component of any preventive service packages. 3,4 Maciosek et al 1 found that approximately 275,000 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) would be saved if influenza vaccination were offered annually to all persons age 50 years and older. After considering the cost-effectiveness and serious health and cost consequences of influenza vaccination, in 2010 the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended annual influenza vaccination for all persons age 6 months and older in the United States. The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) required insurance policies beginning on or after September 23, 2010, to provide full coverage of influenza vaccination with no copayment or coinsurance. Despite its effectiveness and low costs, however, influenza vaccination rates remain low in the United States. The Healthy People 2020 targets include achieving influenza vaccination rates of 90\% in adults aged 65 years and older and 80\% in adults aged 18-64 years, 4 but the actual rates during the 2012-2013 influenza season were only 66.2\% and 35.7\%, respectively. 5 Large racial/ethnic disparities also remain. During the 2012-2013 season, among adults aged 65 and older, 67.9\% of non-Hispanic whites were vaccinated, compared with 54.5\% of non-Hispanic blacks. 5 Of note, the low vaccination rates and racial/ethnic disparities exist in other years as well. Numerous studies have explored possible predictors and causes of low influenza vaccination rates. This area of research is critical for understanding differing prevalence rates and for designing sound public health policies to promote preventive care. In addition to individual-level factors, including socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, general health status, and perceived risks and benefits of influenza vaccination, recent studies have identified contextual/neighborhood characteristics, such as racial/ethnic composition and neighborhood socioeconomic status, as important factors affecting individual decisions as well.},

Objectives and Methods: a) To search for and document recommended/mandated vaccines for GP/FPs in high-income countries; b) To systematically search and review the literature on these physicians' knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors (KABB) toward their own vaccination with the recommended/ mandated vaccines and the factors determining it. Results: a) The 14 countries included recommended or mandated as many as 12 vaccines; b) The systematic review identified 11 studies published in the last 10 y. All considered seasonal influenza vaccination but differed in the variables investigated. Discussion/ Conclusions: This review highlights the need for further studies on this topic, including qualitative and interventional studies (based on behavior change theories). These should cover occupational vaccines and determinants known to be associated with vaccine hesitancy.},

abstract = {Organizational scandals have become all too commonplace; from investment firms' financial improprieties to sexual abuse cover-ups, rule-breaking has become a "nor- mal" feature of organizational life. Although there is considerable scholarly work on rule-breaking, efforts to explain it remain theoretically fragmented. Here we identify two fundamental dimensions of bureaucratic rule-breaking and develop a coherent theoretical conception of it as a structurally patterned and interactionally mediated sociological fact. First, rule-breaking may be permitted or contested by those charged with rule enforcement. Manifestations of rule-breaking take on a routine character only where it is unofficially allowed; where it is not, conflict ensues. Second, the hierarchical structure of bureaucracy is mirrored by an organizational hierarchy of rule-breaking. Rule-breaking can be undertaken by individuals acting alone, it can be coordinated by workgroups, or it can be organized by top management as a matter of unofficial policy. Considering how these two dimensions of rule-breaking interact provides insight into how such actions vary with respect to the full range of organi- zational cross-pressures. Finally, the framework we develop offers an important corrective to the overreliance on the formal aspects of Weber's theorizing about bureaucracy and has considerable utility for generating hypotheses across an array of institutional arenas.},

abstract = {Problem definition: We study a compliance problem of healthcare workers (HCWs) in hospitals where hand hygiene compliance rates are generally low. We first analyze how peer effects impact compliance decisions of HCWs and then analyze how monitoring can improve compliance. Academic/practical relevance: Inducing process compliance of human operators is an ongoing challenge in operations management with significant implications on the productivity and the quality of the products or services rendered by standardized processes. In healthcare, low hand hygiene compliance ofHCWs is the leading cause of hospital-acquired infections, which can be largely prevented by HCWs following standardized hand hygiene processes. Methodology: Using a game- theoretical approach, we model HCWs' reactions to peers' (non-)compliance to determine their equilibrium compliance levels. We integrate the model with a disease-transmission model to determine how the compliance affects disease prevalence in a hospital ward. Results: When the process compliance is endogenous, HCWs play a mixed strategy in equilibrium between complying and noncomplying. We establish that a macrolevel hand hygiene compliance rate of HCWs can result from a combination of four different types of microlevel noncompliance: free-riding, safe-playing, self-regarding, and opportunistic behaviors. Finally, we show that the marginal effect of monitoring on reducing disease prevalence depends on clinical factors, HCWs' interpersonal learning, and other inte- gration factors like goal setting. Managerial implications: The results demonstrate that the monitoring intervention may not effectively prevent disease transmission without un- derstanding the microlevel behaviors of noncompliant HCWs. Our results provide an explanation as to why there is a significant variability in the effectiveness of management intervention as observed in practice.},

Empirical evidence from the field shows that even a modest increase in group-level privacy sustainably and significantly improves line performance, while qualitative evidence suggests that privacy is important in supporting productive deviance, localized experimentation , distraction avoidance, and continuous improvement.

@article{Rao2019,
abstract = {PURPOSE Recent evidence shows a national decline in primary care visit rates over the last decade. It is unclear how changes in practice—including the use and content of primary care visits—may have contributed. METHODS We analyzed nationally representative data of adult visits to primary care physicians (PCPs) and physician practice characteristics from 2007–2016 (National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey). United States census estimates were used to calculate visits per capita. Measures included visit rates per person year; visit duration; number of medications, diagnoses, and preventive services per visit; percentage of visits with scheduled follow-up; and percentage of physicians with practice capabilities including an electronic medical record (EMR). RESULTS Our weighted sample represented 3.2 billion visits (83,368 visits, unweighted). Visits per capita declined by 20\% (–0.25 visits per person, 95\% CI, –0.32 to –0.19) during this time, while visit duration increased by 2.4 minutes per visit (95\% CI, 1.1-3.8). Per visit, PCPs addressed 0.30 more diagnoses (95\% CI, 0.16-0.43) and 0.82 more medications (95\% CI, 0.59-1.1), and provided 0.24 more preventive services (95\% CI, 0.12-0.36). Visits with scheduled PCP follow-up declined by 6.0\% (95\% CI, –12.4 to 0.46), while PCPs reporting use of EMR increased by 44.3\% (95\% CI, 39.1-49.5) and those reporting use of secure messaging increased by 60.9\% (95\% CI, 27.5-94.3). CONCLUSION From 2008 to 2015, primary care visits were longer, addressed more issues per visit, and were less likely to have scheduled follow-up for certain patients and conditions. Meanwhile, more PCPs offered non–face-to-face care. The decline in primary care visit rates may be explained in part by PCPs offering more comprehensive in-person visits and using more non–face-to-face care.},

@article{Friedberg2010,
abstract = {Despite contentious debate over the new national health care reform law, there is an emerging consensus that strengthening primary care will improve health outcomes and restrain the growth of health care spending. Policy discussions imply three general definitions of primary care: a specialty of medical providers, a set of functions served by a usual source of care, and an orientation of health systems. We review the empirical evidence linking each definition of primary care to health care quality, outcomes, and costs. The available evidence most directly supports initiatives to increase providers' ability to serve primary care functions and to reorient health systems to emphasize delivery of primary care. P olicy makers, professional organizations , and purchasers of health care have reached an unusual consensus on the importance of revitalizing primary care. This consensus stems from agreement that primary care is in a deepening crisis, but that effective primary care can improve health outcomes and contain health care costs. Some proposed solutions frame the crisis as a problem of insufficient numbers of primary care physicians. This framing rests on evidence that U.S. medical students are losing interest in primary care careers and that Medicare beneficiaries are beginning to report difficulty finding new primary care physicians. 1,2 Large income differences between specialties may deter medical students from pursuing careers in primary care. 3 This has prompted the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) to recommend a budget-neutral payment increase for "primary care services provided by practitioners who focus on primary care." 2 Other proposals frame the primary care crisis as one of insufficient capability. These proposals include efforts to not only expand the number of patients who have a primary care provider, but also to give these providers new resources such as electronic health records and nonphysician care coordinators. The medical home and Chronic Care Model include sets of interventions intended to enhance and extend the capabilities of primary care providers. 4,5 A third set of proposals attempts to reorient entire health care delivery systems toward primary care. Such proposals call for rebalancing primary and specialty care in the United States-a goal that may require interventions beyond increasing the number of primary care physicians. 6 These proposals also call for basing system-level payment and organizational design on core principles of primary care. 7 Given the magnitude of the investment necessary to revitalize primary care, it is fair to ask what evidence supports current proposals to expand , equip, and empower primary care. In this paper we review the empirical evidence linking primary care to the quality, outcomes, and costs of health care; evaluate the strength of this evidence; and discuss the resulting policy implications.},

abstract = {Importance: The US health care system is typically organized around hospitals and specialty care. The value of primary care remains unclear and debated. Objective: To determine whether an association exists between receipt of primary care and high-value services, low-value services, and patient experience. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is a nationally representative analysis of noninstitutionalized US adults 18 years or older who participated in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Propensity score-weighted quality and experience of care were compared between 49286 US adults with and 21133 adults without primary care from 2012 to 2014. Temporal trends were also analyzed from 2002 to 2014. Exposures: Patient-reported receipt of primary care, determined by the 4 "Cs" of primary care: first-contact care that is comprehensive, continuous, and coordinated. Main Outcomes and Measures: Thirty-nine clinical quality measures and 7 patient experience measures aggregated into 10 clinical quality composites (6 high-value and 4 low-value services), an overall patient experience rating, and 2 experience composites. Results: From 2002 to 2014, the mean annual survey response rate was 58\% (range, 49\%-65\%). Between 2012 and 2014, compared with respondents without primary care (before adjustment), those with primary care were older (50 [95\% CI, 50-51] vs 38 [95\% CI, 38-39] years old), more often female (55\% [95\% CI, 54\%-55\%] vs 42\% [95\% CI, 41\%-43\%]), and predominately white individuals (50\% [95\% CI, 49\%-52\%] vs 43\% [95\% CI, 41\%-45\%]). After propensity score weighting, US adults with or without primary care had the same mean numbers of outpatient (6.7 vs 5.9; difference, 0.8 [95\% CI, -0.2 to 1.8]; P =.11), emergency department (0.2 for both; difference, 0.0 [95\% CI, -0.1 to 0.0]; P =.17), and inpatient (0.1 for both; difference, 0.0 [95\% CI, 0.0-0.0]; P =.92) encounters annually, but those with primary care filled more prescriptions (mean, 14.1 vs 10.7; difference, 3.4 [95\% CI, 2.0-4.7]; P <.001) and were more likely to have a routine preventive visit in the past year (mean, 72.2\% vs 57.5\%; difference, 14.7\% [95\% CI, 12.3\%-17.1\%]; P <.001). From 2012 to 2014, Americans with primary care received more high-value care in 4 of 5 composites. For example, 78\% of those with primary care received high-value cancer screening compared with 67\% without primary care (difference, 10.8\% [95\% CI, 8.5\%-13.0\%]; P <.001). Americans with or without primary care received low-value care with similar frequencies on 3 of 4 composites, although Americans with primary care received more low-value antibiotics (59\% vs 48\%; difference, 11.0\% [95\% CI, 2.8\%-19.3\%] P <.001). Respondents with primary care also reported significantly better health care access and experience. For example, physician communication was highly rated for a greater proportion of those with (64\%) vs without (54\%) primary care (difference, 10.2\%; 95\% CI, 7.2\%-13.1\%; P <.001). Differences in quality and experience between Americans with or without primary care were essentially stable between 2002 and 2014. Conclusions and Relevance: Receipt of primary care was associated with significantly more high-value care, slightly more low-value care, and better health care experience. Policymakers and health system leaders seeking to improve value should consider increasing investments in primary care..},

These mechanisms require further investigation.

Data Sources: 2001 and 2011 American Medical Association Masterfiles and fee-for-service Medicare claims. Study Design/Methods: We calculated two primary care workforce measures within Primary Care Service Areas: the number of primary care physicians per 10,000 population (per capita) and the number of Medicare primary care full-time equivalents (FTEs) per 10,000 Medicare beneficiaries. The three outcomes were mortality, ambulatory care–sensitive condition (ACSC) hospitalizations, and emergency department (ED) visits. We measured the marginal association between changes in primary care workforce and patient outcomes using Poisson regression models. Principal Findings: An increase of one primary care physician per 10,000 population was associated with 15.1 fewer deaths per 100,000 and 39.7 fewer ACSC hospitalizations per 100,000 (both p <.05). An increase of one Medicare primary care FTE per 10,000 beneficiaries was associated with 82.8 fewer deaths per 100,000, 160.8 fewer ACSC hospitalizations per 100,000, and 712.3 fewer ED visits per 100,000 (all p <.05).

abstract = {Importance: Recent US health care reforms incentivize improved population health outcomes and primary care functions. It remains unclear how much improving primary care physician supply can improve population health, independent of other health care and socioeconomic factors. Objectives: To identify primary care physician supply changes across US counties from 2005-2015 and associations between such changes and population mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: This epidemiological study evaluated US population data and individual-level claims data linked to mortality from 2005 to 2015 against changes in primary care and specialist physician supply from 2005 to 2015. Data from 3142 US counties, 7144 primary care service areas, and 306 hospital referral regions were used to investigate the association of primary care physician supply with changes in life expectancy and cause-specific mortality after adjustment for health care, demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral covariates. Analysis was performed from March to July 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Age-standardized life expectancy, cause-specific mortality, and restricted mean survival time. Results: Primary care physician supply increased from 196014 physicians in 2005 to 204419 in 2015. Owing to disproportionate losses of primary care physicians in some counties and population increases, the mean (SD) density of primary care physicians relative to population size decreased from 46.6 per 100000 population (95\% CI, 0.0-114.6 per 100000 population) to 41.4 per 100000 population (95\% CI, 0.0-108.6 per 100000 population), with greater losses in rural areas. In adjusted mixed-effects regressions, every 10 additional primary care physicians per 100000 population was associated with a 51.5-day increase in life expectancy (95\% CI, 29.5-73.5 days; 0.2\% increase), whereas an increase in 10 specialist physicians per 100000 population corresponded to a 19.2-day increase (95\% CI, 7.0-31.3 days). A total of 10 additional primary care physicians per 100000 population was associated with reduced cardiovascular, cancer, and respiratory mortality by 0.9\% to 1.4\%. Analyses at different geographic levels, using instrumental variable regressions, or at the individual level found similar benefits associated with primary care supply. Conclusions and Relevance: Greater primary care physician supply was associated with lower mortality, but per capita supply decreased between 2005 and 2015. Programs to explicitly direct more resources to primary care physician supply may be important for population health.},

abstract = {Data-driven decision-making (DDD) is rapidly transforming modern operations. The availability of Big Data, advances in data analytics tool, and rapid gains in processing power enable firms to make decisions based on data, rather than intuition. Yet, most firms still allow managers to override decisions from DDD tools, as managers might possess private information not present in the DDD tool. We conduct a field-experiment at an automobile spare-parts retailer to examine the profit implications of providing discretionary power to merchants. We find that merchants' overrides of the DDD tool reduce profitability by 5.77\%. However, our analysis over product life cycle (PLC) reveals that merchants increase (decrease) profitability for growth- (mature- and decline-) stage products.},

INFORMS provides unique networking and learning opportunities for individual professionals, and organizations of all types and sizes, to better understand and use O.R. and analytics tools and methods to transform strategic visions and achieve better outcomes. For more information on INFORMS, its publications, membership, or meetings visit Abstract. Many models in operations management involve dynamic decision making that assumes optimal updating in response to information revelation. However, behavioral theory suggests that rather than updating their beliefs, individuals may persevere in their prior beliefs. In particular, we examine how individuals' prior experiences and the experiences of those around them alter their belief perseverance in operational decisions after the revelation of negative news. We draw on an exogenous announcement of negative news by the Food and Drug Administration and explore how it affects interventional car-diologists deciding between two types of cardiac stents. Analyzing 147,000 choices over six years, we find that individuals do respond to negative news by using the focal production tool less often. However, we find that both individuals' own experiences and others' experiences alter their responses. Moreover, although individual and other experience act as substitutes before negative news, we find that this substitution significantly curtails following the negative announcement. Finally, we find that experience leads doctors to discount negative news more rapidly over time. Two lab studies replicate our main findings and show that behavioral biases due to differences in perceptions of expertise drive the effect. Our research contributes not only to operations research but also to the practice of healthcare and operations. History: Accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management.

@article{Thirumalai2011,
abstract = {M edical devices play an increasingly significant role in the delivery of health care today. However, persistent quality problems with medical devices and the associated recalls present potential health risks to patients and personnel using these devices. This study addresses three key issues in this regard. First, it empirically assesses the financial implications of medical device recalls to understand if these consequences are severe enough to deter firms from introducing potentially hazardous medical devices into the market, as can be inferred from the literature. Second, the study considers a cross section of medical device manufacturers to examine the effect of firm characteristics on the costs of poor quality. Third, in an attempt to explore the sources of recalls, this study investigates firm characteristics that are likely to be associated with device recalls. The econometric analyses in the study are based on data from manufacturers in the medical device industry over a four-year period (2002-2005). Contrary to our expectations, the findings of the study indicate that at an aggregate level, the market penalties for medical device recalls are not significant, i.e., at the aggregate level, the costs of poor quality are not severe. Furthermore, we find that the magnitude of financial consequences of device recalls is affected by the product scope, sales, growth prospects, and the capital structure of a firm. In our analyses exploring the sources of device recalls, we find that firms with a research and development focus, developing broader product portfolios, have a higher likelihood of device recalls. Also, we find that the likelihood of recalls decreases with prior recall experience, indicating the presence of learning. Implications of the study findings, limitations, and directions for future research are identified.},

@article{Perdikaki2012,
abstract = {A ttracting shoppers to stores and converting the incoming traffic into sales profitably are vital for the financial health of retailers. In this paper, we use proprietary data pertaining to an apparel retailer to study the relationship between store traffic, labor, and sales performance. We decompose sales volume into conversion rate (defined as the ratio of number of transactions to traffic) and basket value (defined as the ratio of sales volume to number of transactions) and analyze the impact of traffic on sales and its components. We find that store sales volume exhibits diminishing returns to scale with respect to traffic, and labor moderates the impact of traffic on sales. For example, we find that for values of traffic and labor corresponding to the mean, increasing average traffic per hour by one unit increases average sales volume per hour by \$9.97. Further, we find that the marginal returns to traffic increases from \$10.00 to \$11.32 when labor increases by one standard deviation. In addition, we find that the conversion rate declines with increasing traffic and a lower conversion rate is associated with a decrease in future traffic growth. Our study underscores the importance of in-store operations in driving the financial performance of retailers.},

This is the first large-scale study to explore how employee outcomes such as employment, earnings, and health and safety change when employers adopt ISO 9001. We analyzed a matched sample of nearly 1,000 companies in California. ISO 9001 adopters subsequently had far lower organizational death rates than a matched control group of nonadopters. Among surviving employers, ISO adopters had higher growth rates for sales, employment, payroll, and average annual earnings. Injury rates declined slightly for ISO 9001 adopters, although total injury costs did not. These results have implications for organizational theory, managers, and public policy.},

@article{Hendricks2005,
abstract = {This paper empirically documents the association between supply chain glitches and operating performance. The results are based on a sample of 885 glitches announced by publicly traded firms. Changes in various operating performance metrics for the sample firms are compared against a sample of control firms of similar size and from similar industries. In the year leading up to the announcement, the control-adjusted mean percent changes in operating income, return on sales, and return on assets for the sample firms are −107\%, −114\%, and −92\%, respectively. During this same period, the control-adjusted changes in the level of return on sales and return on assets are −13.78\% and −2.32\%, respectively. Relative to controls, firms that experience glitches report on average 6.92\% lower sales growth, 10.66\% higher growth in cost, and 13.88\% higher growth in inventories. More importantly, firms do not quickly recover from the negative economic consequences of glitches. During the two-year time period after the glitch announcement, operating income, sales, total costs, and inventories do not improve. We also find that it does not matter who caused the glitch, what the reason was for the glitch, or what industry a firm belongs to—glitches are associated with negative operating performance across the board.},
